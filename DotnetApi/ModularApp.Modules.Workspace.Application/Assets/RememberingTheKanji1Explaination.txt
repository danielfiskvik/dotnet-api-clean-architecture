一|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>One</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>In Chinese characters, the number <strong>one </strong>is laid on its side, unlike the Roman numeral I which stands upright. As you would expect, it is written from left to right. [1]<br></div><div><br></div><div>* As a primitive element, the key-word meaning is discarded, since it is too abstract to be of much help. Instead, the single horizontal stroke takes on the meaning of <em>floor </em>or <em>ceiling</em>, depending on its&nbsp;position: if it stands above another primitive, it means <em>ceiling</em>; if below, <em>floor</em>.</div></div>
二|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Two</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Like the Roman numeral II, which reduplicates the numeral I, the kanji for <strong>two </strong>is a simple reduplication of the horizontal stroke that means <em>one</em>. The order of writing goes from above to below, with the first stroke slightly shorter. [2]</div></div>
三|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Three</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>And like the Roman numeral III, which triples the numeral I, the kanji for <strong>three</strong> simply triples the single horizontal stroke. In writing it, think of “1 + 2 = 3” (⼀ + ⼆ = 三) in order to keep the middle stroke shorter. [3]</div></div>
四|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Four</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>This kanji is composed of two primitive elements, <em>mouth </em>⼝ and <em>human legs</em> ⼉, both of which we will meet in the coming lessons. Assuming that you already knew how to write this kanji, we will pass over the “story” connected with it until later. Note how the second stroke is written left-to-right and then top-to-bottom. This is consistent with what we have already seen in the first three numbers and leads us to a general principle that will be helpful when we come to more complicated kanji later on: WRITE NORTH-TO-SOUTH, WEST-TO-EAST, NORTHWEST-TOSOUTHEAST. [5]</div></div>
五|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Five</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>As with <em>four</em>, we shall postpone learning the primitive elements that make up this character. Note how the general principle we just learned in the preceding frame applies to the writing of the character for <strong>five</strong>. [4]</div></div>
六|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Six</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The primitives here are <em>top hat</em> and <em>animal legs</em>. Once again, we glide over them until later. [4]</div></div>
七|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Seven</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>As with <em>four</em>, we shall postpone learning the primitive elements that make up this character. Note how the general principle we just learned in the preceding frame applies to the writing of the character for five. [4] Note that the first stroke “cuts” through the second. This distinguishes <strong>seven </strong>from the character for <em>spoon </em>⼔ (FRAME 476), in which the horizontal stroke stops short. [2]</div><div><br></div><div>* As a primitive, this form takes on the meaning of <em>diced</em>, i.e., “cut” into little pieces, consistent both with the way the character is written and with its association with the kanji for <em>cut </em>切 to be learned in a later lesson (FRAME 89).</div></div>
八|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Eight</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Just as the Arabic numeral “8” is composed of a small circle followed by a larger one, so the kanji for <strong>eight </strong>is composed of a short line followed by a longer line, slanting towards it but not touching it. And just as the “lazy 8” ∞ is the mathematical symbol for “infinity,” so the expanse opened up below these two strokes is associated by the Japanese with the sense of an infinite expanse or something “all-encompassing.” [2]</div></div>
九|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Nine</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>If you take care to remember the stroke order of this kanji, you will not have trouble later keeping it distinct from the kanji for <em>power </em>⼒ (FRAME 922). [2]</div><div><br></div><div>*&nbsp;As a primitive, we shall use this kanji to mean <em>baseball team</em> or simply <em>baseball</em>. The meaning, of course, is derived from the nine players who make up a team.</div></div>
十|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Ten</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Turn this character 45º either way and you have the X used for the Roman numeral <strong>ten</strong>. [2]<br></div><div><br></div><div>* As a primitive, this character sometimes keeps its meaning of <em>ten </em>and sometimes signifies <em>needle</em>, this latter derived from the kanji for needle 針 (FRAME 292). Since the primitive is used in the kanji itself, there is no need to worry about confusing the two. In fact, we shall be following this procedure regularly.</div></div>
口|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Mouth</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Like several of the first characters we shall learn, the kanji for <strong>mouth </strong>is a clear pictograph. Since there are no circular shapes in the kanji, the square must be used to depict the circle. [3]</div><div><br></div><div>*&nbsp;As a primitive, this form also means <em>mouth</em>. Any of the range of possible images that the word suggests—an opening or entrance to a cave, a river, a bottle, or even the largest hole in your head—can be used for the primitive meaning.</div></div>
日|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Day</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>This kanji is intended to be a pictograph of the sun. Recalling what we said in the previous frame about round forms, it is easy to detect the circle and the big smile that characterize our simplest drawings of the sun—like those yellow badges with the words, “Have a nice <strong>day</strong>!” [4]</div><div><br></div><div>* Used as a primitive, this kanji can mean <em>sun </em>or <em>day </em>or a <em>tongue wagging in the mouth</em>. This latter meaning, incidentally, derives from an old character outside the standard list meaning something like “sayeth” and written almost exactly the same, except that the stroke in the middle does not touch the right side (⽈, FRAME 620).</div></div>
月|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Month</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>This character is actually a picture of the moon, with the two horizontal lines representing the left eye and mouth of the mythical “man in the moon.” (Actually&nbsp;the Japanese see a hare in the moon, but it is a little farfetched to find one in the kanji.) And one <strong>month</strong>, of course, is one cycle of the moon. [4]<br></div><div><br></div><div>*&nbsp;As a primitive element, this character can take on the sense of <em>moon</em>, <em>flesh</em>, or <em>part of the body</em>. The reasons for the latter two meanings will be explained in a later chapter.</div></div>
田|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Rice field</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Another pictograph, this kanji looks like a bird’s-eye view of a <strong>rice field</strong> divided into four plots. Be careful when writing this character to get the order of the strokes correct. You will find that it follows perfectly the principle stated in FRAME 4. [5]</div><div><br></div><div>* When used as a primitive element, the meaning of <em>rice field</em> is most common, but now and again it will take the meaning of <em>brains </em>from the fact that it looks a bit like that tangle of gray matter nestled under our skulls.</div></div>
目|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>Eye</b>.</div><div><br></div><div>Here again, if we round out the corners of this kanji and curve the middle strokes upwards and downwards respectively, we get something resembling an <strong>eye</strong>. [5]<br></div><div><br></div><div>*&nbsp;As a primitive, the kanji keeps its sense of <em>eye</em>, or to be more specific, an <em>eyeball</em>. When placed in the surroundings of a complex kanji, the primitive will sometimes be turned on its side like this: ⺫.</div></div>
古|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>Old</b>.</div><div><br></div><div>The primitive elements that compose this character are <em>ten </em>and <em>mouth</em>, but you may find it easier to remember it as a pictograph of a tombstone with a cross on top. Just think back to one of those graveyards you have visited, or better still, used to play in as a child, with <strong>old </strong>inscriptions on the tombstones.<br></div><div>This departure from the primitive elements in favor of a pictograph will take place now and again at these early stages, and almost never after that. So you need not worry about cluttering up your memory with too many character “drawings.” [5]</div><div><br></div><div>*&nbsp;Used as a primitive element, this kanji keeps its key-word sense of <em>old</em>, but care should be taken to make that abstract notion as graphic as possible.</div></div>
吾|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>I</b>.</div><div><br></div><div>There are a number of kanji for the word <strong>I</strong>, but the&nbsp;others tend to be more specific than this one. The key word here should be taken in the general psychological sense of the “perceiving subject.” Now the one place in our bodies that all <em>five </em>senses are concentrated in is the head, which has no less than <em>five mouths</em>: 2 nostrils, 2 ears, and 1 mouth. Hence, <em>five mouths</em> = <strong>I</strong>. [7]</div></div>
冒|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Risk</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Remember when you were young and your mother told you never to look directly into the <em>sun </em>for fear you might burn out your <em>eyes</em>? Probably you were foolish enough to <strong>risk </strong>a quick glance once or twice; but just as probably, you passed that bit of folk wisdom on to someone else as you grew older. Here, too, the kanji that has a <em>sun </em>above and an <em>eye </em>right below looking up at it has the meaning of <strong>risk </strong>(see FRAME 12). [9]</div></div>
朋|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Companion</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The first <strong>companion </strong>that God made, as the Bible story goes, was Eve. Upon seeing her, Adam exclaimed, “<em>Flesh </em>of my <em>flesh</em>!” And that is precisely what this kanji says in so many strokes. [8]</div></div>
明|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>Bright</b>.</div><div><br></div><div>Among nature’s <strong>bright </strong>lights, there are two that the biblical myth has God set in the sky: the <em>sun </em>to rule over the day and the <em>moon</em> to rule the night. Each of them has come to represent one of the common&nbsp;connotations of this key word: the <em>sun</em>, the <strong>bright </strong>insight of the clear thinker, and the <em>moon</em>, the <strong>bright </strong>intuition of the poet and the seer (see FRAME 13). [8]</div></div>
唱|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>Chant</b>.</div><div><br></div><div>This one is easy! You have one <em>mouth </em>making no noise (the choirmaster) and two <em>mouths </em>with <em>wagging tongues</em> (the minimum for a chorus). So think of the key word, <strong>chant</strong>, as monastery singing and the kanji is yours forever (see FRAME 11). [11]</div></div>
晶|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>Sparkle</b>.</div><div><br></div><div>What else can the word <strong>sparkle </strong>suggest if not a diamond? And if you’ve ever held a diamond up to the light, you will have noticed how every facet of it becomes like a miniature <em>sun</em>. This kanji is a picture of a tiny <em>sun </em>in three places (that is, “everywhere”), to give the sense of something that <strong>sparkles </strong>on all sides. Just like a diamond. In writing the primitive elements three times, note again how the rule for writing given in FRAME 4 holds true not only for the strokes in each individual element but also for the disposition of the elements in the character as a whole. [12]</div></div>
品|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>Goods</b>.</div><div><br></div><div>As in the character for <em>sparkle</em>, the triplication of a single element in this character indicates “everywhere” or “heaps of.” When we think of <strong>goods </strong>in modern industrial society, we think of what has&nbsp;been mass-produced—that is to say, produced for the “masses” of open <em>mouths </em>waiting like fledglings in a nest to “consume” whatever comes their way. [9]</div></div>
呂|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Spine</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>This character is rather like a picture of two of the vertebrae in the <strong>spine </strong>linked by a single stroke. [7]</div></div>
昌|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Prosperous</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>What we mentioned in the previous two frames about 3 of something meaning “everywhere” or “heaps of” was not meant to be taken lightly. In this kanji we see <em>two suns</em>, one atop the other, which, if we are not careful, is easily confused in memory with the <em>three suns of sparkle</em>. Focus on the number this way: since we speak of <strong>prosperous </strong>times as <em>sunny</em>, what could be more <strong>prosperous </strong>than a sky with <em>two suns</em> in it? Just be sure to actually SEE them there. [8]</div></div>
早|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>Early</b>.</div><div><br></div><div>This kanji is actually a picture of the first flower of the day, which we shall, in defiance of botanical science, call the <em>sun</em>-flower, since it begins with the element for <em>sun </em>and is held up on a stem with leaves (the pictographic representation of the final two strokes). This time, however, we shall ignore the pictograph and imagine <em>sun</em>flowers with <em>needles </em>for stems, which can be plucked and used to darn your socks.<br></div><div>The sense of <strong>early </strong>is easily remembered if one thinks of the <em>sun</em>flower as the <strong>early </strong>riser in the&nbsp;garden, because the <em>sun</em>, showing favoritism towards its namesake, shines on it before all the others (see FRAME 10). [6]</div><div><br></div><div>*&nbsp;As a primitive element, this kanji takes the meaning of <em>sun-flower</em>, which was used to make the abstract key word <em>early </em>more graphic.</div></div>
旭|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Rising sun</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>This character is a sort of nickname for the Japanese flag with its well-known emblem of the <strong>rising sun.</strong> If you can picture two seams running down that great red <em>sun</em>, and then imagine it sitting on a <em>baseball</em> bat for a flagpole, you have a slightly irreverent—but not altogether inaccurate—picture of how the sport has caught on in the Land of the <strong>Rising Sun</strong>. [6]</div></div>
世|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Generation</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>We generally consider one <strong>generation </strong>as a period of thirty (or <em>ten </em>plus <em>ten</em> plus <em>ten</em>) years. If you look at this kanji in its completed form—not in its stroke order —you will see three <em>tens</em>. When writing it, think of the lower horizontal lines as “addition” lines written under numbers to add them up. Thus: <em>ten </em>“plus” <em>ten </em>“plus” <em>ten </em>= thirty. Actually, it’s a lot easier doing it with a pencil than reading it in a book. [5]</div></div>
胃|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Stomach</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>You will need to refer back to FRAMES 13 and 14 here for the special meaning of the two primitive elements that make up this character: flesh (<em>part of the body</em>) and <em>brain</em>. What the kanji says, if you look at it, is that the <em>part of the body</em> that keeps the <em>brain </em>in working order is the <strong>stomach</strong>. To keep the elements in proper order, when you write this kanji think of the <em>brain </em>as being “held up” by the <em>flesh</em>. [9]</div></div>
旦|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Nightbreak (Dawn)</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>While we normally refer to the start of the day as “daybreak,” Japanese commonly refers to it as the “opening up of night” into day. Hence the choice of this rather odd key word, <strong>nightbreak</strong>. The single stroke at the bottom represents the <em>floor </em>(have a peek again at FRAME 1) or the horizon over which the <em>sun </em>is poking its head. [5]</div></div>
胆|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Gall bladder</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The pieces in this character should be easily recognizable: on the left, the element for <em>part of the body</em>, and on the right, the character for <em>nightbreak</em>, which we have just met. What all of this has to do with the <strong>gall bladder</strong> is not immediately clear. But all we need to do is give a slight twist to the traditional biblical advice about not letting the sun set on your anger (which ancient medicine associated with the choler or bile that the <strong>gall bladder</strong> is supposed to filter out), and change it to “not letting the <em>night break</em> on your anger” (or your <strong>gall</strong>)—and the work of remembering the kanji is done. And the improvement is not a bad piece of advice in its own right, since anger, like so many other things, can often be calmed&nbsp;by letting the sun set on it and then “sleeping it off.” [9]</div></div>
亘|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Span</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>“Sunrise, sunset, sunrise, sunset…” goes the song of the Fiddler on the Roof. You can almost see the journey of the <em>sun </em>as it moves from one horizon (the <em>floor</em>) to its noonday heights in the sky overhead (<em>ceiling</em>) and then disappears over the other horizon— day after day, marking the <strong>span </strong>of our lives. [6]</div></div>
凹|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Concave</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>You couldn’t have asked for a better key word for this kanji! Just have a look at it: a perfect image of a <strong>concave </strong>lens (remembering, of course, that the kanji square off rounded things), complete with its own little “cave.” Now all you have to do is learn how to write it. [5]</div></div>
凸|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Convex</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Maybe this helps you see how the Japanese have no&nbsp;trouble keeping <strong>convex </strong>distinct from <em>concave</em>. Note the odd feeling of the third stroke. If it doesn’t feel all that strange now, by the time you are done with this book, it will. There are very few times you will have to write it. [5]</div></div>
旧|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Olden times</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>A <em>walking stick</em> is needed for days of <strong>olden times</strong>, since <em>days</em>, too, get old—at least insofar as we refer to them as the “good old days.” The main thing here is to think of “good old days” when you hear the key word <strong>olden times</strong>. The rest will take care of itself. [5]</div></div>
自|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Oneself</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>You can think of this kanji as a stylized pictograph of the nose, that little <em>drop </em>that Mother Nature set between your <em>eyes</em>. The Japanese refer to themselves by pointing a finger at their nose—giving us an easy way to remember the kanji for <strong>oneself</strong>. [6]</div></div>
白|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>White</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The color <strong>white</strong> is a mixture of all the primary colors, both for pigments and for light, as we see when a prism breaks up the rays of the <em>sun</em>. Hence, a single <em>drop </em>of <em>sun </em>spells <strong>white</strong>. [5]</div><div><br></div><div>*&nbsp;As a primitive, this character can either retain its meaning of <em>white </em>or take the more graphic meaning of a <em>white bird</em> or <em>dove</em>. This latter stems from the fact that it appears at the top of the kanji for <em>bird</em>, which we shall get to later (FRAME 2091).</div></div>
百|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Hundred</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The Japanese refer to a person’s 99th birthday as a “<em>white </em>year” because <em>white</em> is the kanji you are left with if you subtract <em>one </em>from a <strong>hundred</strong>. [6]</div></div>
中|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>In</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The elements here are a <em>walking stick</em> and a <strong>mouth</strong>. Remember the trouble your mother had getting medicine <strong>in </strong>your <em>mouth</em>? Chances are it crossed her mind more than once to grab something handy, like your grandfather’s <em>walking stick</em>, to pry open your jaws while she performed her duty. Keep the image of getting something <strong>in </strong>from the outside, and the otherwise abstract sense of this key word should be a lot easier than trying to spoon castor oil <strong>in</strong>to a baby’s mouth. [4]</div></div>
千|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Thousand</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>This kanji is almost too simple to pull apart, but for&nbsp;the sake of practice, have a look at the <em>eyedropper </em>above and the <em>ten </em>below. Now put the elements together by thinking of squeezing two more zeros out of an <em>eyedropper </em>alongside the number <em>ten </em>to make it a <strong>thousand</strong>. [3]</div></div>
舌|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Tongue</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The primitive for <em>mouth </em>and the character for <em>thousand </em>naturally form the idea of <strong>tongue </strong>if one thinks of a <em>thousand mouths</em> able to speak the same language, or as we say, “sharing a common <strong>tongue</strong>.” It is easy to see the connection between the idiom and the kanji if you take its image literally: a single <strong>tongue </strong>being passed around from <em>mouth </em>to <em>mouth</em>. [6]</div></div>
升|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Measuring box</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>This is the character for the little wooden box that the Japanese use for measuring things, as well as for drinking saké out of. Simply imagine the outside as spiked with a <em>thousand </em>sharp needles, and the quaint little <strong>measuring box</strong> becomes a drinker’s nightmare! Be very careful when you write this character not to confuse it with the writing of <em>thousand</em>. The reason for the difference gives us a chance to clarify another general principle of writing that supersedes the one we mentioned in FRAME 4: WHEN A SINGLE STROKE RUNS VERTICALLY THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF A CHARACTER, IT IS WRITTEN LAST. [4]</div></div>
昇|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Rise up</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Our image here is made up of two primitive elements: a <em>sun </em>and a <em>measuring box</em>. Just as the <em>sun </em>can be seen <strong>rising up</strong> in the morning from—where else—the Land of the Rising Sun, this kanji has the <em>sun </em><strong>rising up</strong> out of a Japanese <em>measuring box</em>—the “<em>measuring box</em> of the <strong>rising-up </strong><em>sun</em>.” [8]</div></div>
丸|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Round</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>We speak of “<strong>round </strong>numbers,” or “<strong>rounding </strong>a number off,” meaning to add an insignificant amount to bring it to the nearest 10. For instance, if you add just a wee bit, the tiniest <em>drop</em>, to nine, you end up with a <strong>round </strong>number. [3]<br></div><div><br></div><div>* As a primitive, this element takes the meaning of a <em>fat man</em>. Think of a grotesquely <em>fat man</em> whose paunch so covers the plate that he is always getting hit by the pitch. Hence a <em>round baseball playe</em>r becomes a <em>fat man</em>.</div></div>
寸|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>This kanji actually stood for a small <strong>measurement </strong>used prior to the metric system, a bit over an inch in length, and from there acquired the sense of <strong>measurement</strong>. In the old system, it was <em>one-tenth</em> of a <em>shaku</em>. The picture, appropriately, represents one drop of a ten (with a hook!). [3]<br></div><div><br></div><div>* As a primitive, we shall use this to mean <em>glue </em>or <em>glued to</em>. There is no need to devise a story to remember this, since the primitive will appear so often you would have to struggle har NOT to remember it.</div></div>
肘|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div>Instead of the familiar "grease" we usually associate with the <strong>elbow </strong>of someone hard at work, the kanji gives us a <em>part of the body</em> that has been <em>glued to</em> its task. [7]<br></div>
専|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div><em>Ten ... rice fields ... glue</em>. That's how one would read the primitive elements of this kanji from top to bottom. Now if we make a simple sentence out of these element, we get: "<em>Ten rice fields glued</em> together".<br></div><div><br></div><div>A <strong>speciality</strong>, of course, refers to one's special "<em>field</em>" of endeavor or competence. In fact, few people remain content with a single <strong>speciality </strong>and usually extend themselves in other <em>fields </em>as well. This is how we come to get the picture of <em>ten fields glued</em> together to represent a <strong>speciality</strong>. [9]</div></div>
博|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>At the left we have a <em>needle</em>; at the right; the kanji for <em>speciality</em>, plus an extra <em>drop </em>at the top. Think of a <strong>Dr.</strong> who is a <em>specialist </em>with a needle (an acupuncturist) and let the <em>drop</em> at the top represent the period at the end of <strong>Dr.</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>In principle we are trying to avoid this kind of device, which plays on abstract grammatical conventions; but I think you will agree, after you have had occasion to use the right side of this kanji in forming other kanji, that the exception is merited in this case. [12]</div></div>
占|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Fortune-telling</strong>.<br></div><div><br></div><div>This is one of those kanji that is real joy of simplicity: a <em>diving rod</em> with a <em>mouth </em>- which translate directly into <strong>fortune-telling</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Note how the movement from top to bottom (the movement in which the kanji are written) is also the order of the elements which make up our story and of the key word itself: first <em>divining rod</em>, then <em>mouth</em>. This will not always be possible, but it is, memory has almost no work at all to do. [5]</div></div>
上|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Above</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The two directions, <strong>above </strong>and below, are usually pointed at with the finger. But the characters do not follow that custom, so we have to choose something else, easily remembered. The primitives show a <em>magic wand</em> standing <em>above a floor</em>—“magically,” you might say. Anyway, go right on to the next frame, since the two belong together and are best remembered as a unit, just as the words <strong>above </strong>and <em>below </em>suggest each other. [3]</div></div>
下|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Below</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Here we see our famous miraculous <em>magic wand</em> hanging, all on its own, <strong>below </strong>the <em>ceiling</em>, as you probably already guessed would happen. In addition to giving us two new kanji, the two shapes given in this and the preceding frame also serve to fix the use of the primitives for <em>ceiling </em>and <em>floor</em>, by drawing our attention successively to the line standing above and <strong>below </strong>the primitive element to which it is related. [3]</div></div>
卓|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div>The word <strong>eminent </strong>suggests a famous or well-known person. So all you need to do - given the primitives of a <em>magic wand</em> and a <em>sunflower </em>- is to think of the world's most <strong>eminent </strong>magician as one who uses a <em>sunflower </em>for a <em>magic wand</em> (like a flower-child who goes around turning the world into peace and love). [8]<br></div>
朝|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div>On the right we see the <em>moon </em>fading off into the first light of <strong>morning</strong>, and to the left, the <em>mist </em>that falls to give nature a shower to prepare it for the coming heat. If you can think of the <em>moon </em>tilting over to spill <em>mist </em>on the garden, you should have no trouble remembering which of all the elements in this story are to serve as primitives for constructing the character. [12]<br></div>
嘲|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>The bad feeling created by words spoken in <strong>derision </strong>often leaves a bad taste in the <em>mouth </em>of the one who speaks them, kind of like the foul aftertaste that follows a night before of too much of the wrong stuff - or what we call <em>morning mouth</em>. [15]</div><div><br></div><div>Synonym of derision (google translate): mockery.</div></div>
只|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Only</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>When we run across abstract key words like this one, the best way to get an image it to recall some common but suggestive phrase in which the word appears. For instance, we can think of the expression “it’s the <strong>only </strong>one of its kind.” Then we imagine a barker at a side-show advertising some strange pacman like creature he has inside his tent, with only a gigantic <em>mouth </em>and two wee <em>animal legs</em>. [5]</div></div>
貝|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Shellfish</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>To remember the primitive elements that make up this kanji, an <em>eye </em>and <em>animal legs</em>, you might be tempted to think of it as a pictograph of a <strong>shellfish </strong>with its&nbsp;ridged shell at the top and two little <em>legs</em> sticking out of the bottom. But that might not help you recall later just how many ridges to put on the shell. Better to imagine a freakish <strong>shellfish </strong>with a single, gigantic <em>eye </em>roaming the beaches on its slender little <em>legs</em>, scaring the wits out of the sunbathers. [7]</div><div><br></div><div>*&nbsp;When used as a primitive, in addition to <em>shells</em>, the meanings <em>oyster </em>and <em>clam </em>will often come in handy.</div></div>
唄|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Pop song</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>There is a lot of money to be made if one’s <strong>songs </strong>are “<strong>pop</strong>ular.” This is depicted here as a stream of <em>clams </em>spewing out of the <em>mouth </em>of someone performing a <strong>pop song</strong>. [10]</div></div>
貞|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Upright</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Now take the last primitive, the <em>shellfish</em>, and set a <em>magic wand</em> over it, and you have the kanji for <strong>upright</strong>. After all, the <em>clam </em>and the <em>oyster </em>are incapable of walking <strong>upright</strong>. It would take a magician with his <em>wand </em>to pull off such a feat—which is precisely what we have in this kanji. [9]</div></div>
員|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Employee</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>How do we get a mouth over a <em>shellfish </em>to mean an <strong>employee</strong>? Simple. Just remember the advice new <strong>employees </strong>get about keeping their <em>mouths</em> shut and doing their job, and then make that more graphic by&nbsp;picturing an office building full of white-collar workers scurrying around with <em>clams </em>pinched to their <em>mouths</em>. [10]</div></div>
貼|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Post a bill</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The word in this frame has to do with <strong>posting bills</strong> to a billboard. In this case, the billboard is standing at the exit to a Chinese restaurant displaying the latest alternative to the traditional <em>fortune-telling</em> cookies. Look closely and you will see rows of leftover shells of <em>clams </em>with the little slips of paper sticking out of them posted to the billboard. [12]</div></div>
見|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>See</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The elements that compose the character for <strong>see </strong>are the <em>eye </em>firmly fixed to a pair of <em>human legs</em>. Surely, somewhere in your experience, there is a vivid image just waiting to be dragged up to help you remember this character…. [7]</div></div>
児|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Newborn babe</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The top part of the kanji in this frame, you will remember, is the character for <em>olden times</em>, those <em>days </em>so old they needed a <em>walking stick</em> to get around. Western mythical imagination has old “Father Time” leaning on his sickle with a <strong>newborn babe</strong> crawling around his <em>legs</em>, the idea being that the circle of birthand-death goes on. This is the first of three times that the kanji for <em>olden times</em> will appear in this book as a primitive element in another kanji, so try to make the most of it. [7]</div></div>
元|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>Beginning</b>.</div><div><br></div><div><div>"In the beginning..." starts that marvelous shelf of books we call the bible. It talks about how all things were made, and tells us that when the Creator came to humanity she made <em>two </em>of them, man and woman. While we presume she made <em>two </em>of every other animal as well, we are not told as much. Hence we need only <em>two </em>and a pair of <em>human legs</em> come to the kanji that means <strong>beginning</strong>. [4]</div></div></div>
頁|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Page</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>What we have to do here is to turn a <em>shellfish </em>into a <strong>page </strong>of a book. The <em>one </em>at the top tells us that we only get a rather short book, in fact a book of only <em>one</em> <strong>page</strong>. Imagine a little print on the shell of an <em>oyster</em>, let us say "Pearl of Wisdom", and then open the quaint book to its <em>one </em>and only <strong>page</strong>, on which you find a single, radiant <em>drop </em>of wisdom, one of the masterpiece poems of nature. [9]</div><div><br></div><div>* As a primitive, this kanji takes the unrelated meaning of a <em>head </em>(preferably one detached from its body), derived from the character for <em>head</em>.</div></div>
頑|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>Stubborn</b>.</div><div><br></div><div>This character refers to the block<em>headed</em>, persistent <strong>stubbornes</strong> of one who sticks to an idea or a plan just the way it was at the&nbsp;<em>beginning</em>, without letting anything that comes up along the way alter things in the least. The explanation make "sense", but is hard to remember because the word "<em>beginning</em>" is too abstract.</div><div><br></div><div>Back up to the image we used two frames ago - Adam and Eve in their Eden - and try again: The root of all <strong>stubbornes </strong>goes back to the <em>beginning</em>, with two brothers each <strong>stubbornly</strong> defending his own way of life and asking their God to bless it favorably. Cain stuck to agriculture, Abel to animal-raising. Picture these two with their giant, swelled <em>heads</em>, each vying for the favors of heaven, a <strong>stubborn </strong>grimace on their faces. No wonder something unfortunate happened! [13]</div></div>
凡|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>Mediocre</b>.</div><div><br></div><div>While we refer to something insignificant as a "<em>drop </em>in the bucket", the kanji for <strong>mediocre </strong>suggests the image for a "<em>drop </em>in the <em>wind</em>". [3]</div></div>
負|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>Defeat</b>.</div><div><br></div><div>Above we have the condensed form of <em>bound up</em>, and below the familiar <em>shellfish</em>. Now imagine two <em>oysters </em>engaged in <em>shell</em>-to-<em>shell </em>combat, the one who is <strong>defeated </strong>being <em>bound and gagged</em> with seaweed, the victor towering triumphantly over it. The <em>bound shellfish </em>thus becomes the symbol of <strong>defeat</strong>. [9]</div></div>
万|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>Ten thousand</b>.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Japanese counts higher numbers in units of <strong>ten thousand</strong>, unlike the West, which advanced according to units of one thousand. (Thus, for instance, 40,000 would be read "four <strong>ten-thousands</strong>" by a Japanese). Given that the comma is used in larger numbers to <em>bind up</em> a numerical unit of one thousand, the elements for <em>one </em>and <em>bound up</em> naturally come to form <strong>ten thousand</strong>.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The order of strokes here needs special attention, both because it falls outside the general principles we have learned already, and because it involves writing the element for <em>bound up</em> in an order opposite to the one we learned. If it is any consolation, this happens every time these three strokes comes together. [3]</div></div>
句|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Phrase</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>By combining the two primitives <em>bound up</em> and <em>mouth</em>, it is easy to see how this character can get the meaning of a <strong>phrase</strong>. After all, a <strong>phrase</strong> is nothing more than a number of words <em>bound up</em> tightly and neatly so that they will fit in your <em>mouth</em>. [5]</div></div>
肌|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Texture</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Ever noticed how the <strong>texture </strong>of your face and hands is affected by the <em>wind</em>? A day's skiing or sailing makes them rough and dry, and in need of a good soft cream to soothe the burn. So whenever a <em>part of the body</em> gets exposed to the <em>wind</em>, it's <strong>texture </strong>is affected. (If it is any help, the Latin word hiding inside <strong>texture </strong>connotes how something is "to the touch.") [6]</div></div>
旬|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>decameron</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>There simply is not a good phrase in English for the block of ten days which this character represents. So we resurrect the classical phrase, <strong>decameron</strong>, whose connotations the tales of Boccaccio have done much to enrich. Actually, it refers to a journey of <em>ten </em>days taken by a band of people - that is, a group of people <em>bound together</em> for the <em>days </em>of the <strong>decameron</strong>. [6]</div></div>
勺|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>ladle</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>If you want to <em>bind up drops</em> of anything - water, soup, lemonade - you use something to scoop these <em>drops up</em>, which is what we call a <strong>ladle</strong>. See the last <em>drop </em>left inside the <strong>ladle</strong>?&nbsp; [3]</div></div>
的|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>bull's eye</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The elements <em>white bird</em> and <em>ladle </em>easily suggest the image of a <strong>bull's eye</strong> if you image a rusty old <em>ladle</em> with a bull's eye painted on it in the form of a tiny <em>white bird</em>, who lets out a little "peep" every time you hit the target. [8]</div></div>
首|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>neck</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Reading this kanji from the top down, we have : <em>horns ... nose</em>. Together they bring to mind the picture of a moose-head hanging on the den wall, with its great <em>horns </em>and long <em>nose</em>. Now while we would speak of cutting off a moose's "head" to hang on the wall, the japanese speak of cutting off its <strong>neck</strong>. It's all a matter of how you look at it. Anyway, if you let the word <strong>neck </strong>conjure up the image of a moose with a very l-o-n-g <strong>neck </strong>hanging over the fireplace, whose <em>horns </em>you use for a coat-rack and whose <em>nose </em>has spigots left and right for scotch and water, you should have no trouble with the character.</div><div><br></div><div>Here we get a good look at what we mentioned when we first introduced the elements for horns: that they can never be left floating free and require an extra horizontal stroke to prevent that from happening, as is the case here. [9]</div></div>
乙|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>fish guts</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The kanji shown here actually represents the "second" position in the old Chinese zodiac, which the Japanese still use as an alternative way of enumeration, much the same way that English will revert to Roman numerals. Among it's many other meanings are "pure", "tasteful", "quaint", and - get this! - <strong>fish guts</strong>. Since it is a pictograph of a fishhook, it should not be hard to associate it with the key word. [1]</div><div><br></div><div>* We will take <em>fishhook</em> and <em>hook </em>as primitive meanings. The shape will rarely be quite the same as that of the kanji when used as component in other kanji.</div></div>
乱|<h1>Remembering the kanji</h1><div><div>Meaning:&nbsp;<strong>Riot</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>In a <strong>riot</strong>, manners are laid aside and tempers get short, even in so courtesy-conscious a land as Japan. This Kanji shows what happens to a&nbsp;<strong>rioting&nbsp;</strong>tongue: it gets "barbed" like a fishhook, and sets to attacking the opposition, to hook them as it were. [7]</div></div>
直|<h1><img src="paste-2b60577789d715b9a9892d17246cd552d120b7f5.jpg" style="font-size: 20px;"><br></h1><div>Important! Not sure why, but I can find this kanji in WaniKani with the "L" in the beginning of the kanji, but when pasting it in Rider or Anki, then it disappears. It does the same when I paste it in google search. I think it is probably the font that is removing it.<br></div><h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>Straightaway</b>.</div><div><br></div><div>Begin with the top two primitives, <em>needle </em>and <em>eye</em>. Together they represent the <em>eye of a needle</em>. Below is a <em>fishhook </em>that has been <strong>straightened out</strong> and its bard removed so that it can pass through the eye of the needle. [8]</div></div>
具|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning:&nbsp;<strong>Tool</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Here is the full kanji on which the last frame was based. If you can think of a table full of carpenter's <strong>tools </strong>of all sorts, each equipped with its own <em>eye </em>so that it can keep a watch over what you are doing with it, you won't have trouble later keeping the primitive and the kanji apart. [8]</div></div>
真|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning:&nbsp;<strong>True</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Here again we meet the composite element, <em>eye of a needle</em>, which here combines with <em>tool </em>give us a measure of what is <strong>true </strong>and what is not. [10]</div></div>
工|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning:&nbsp;<strong>Craft</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The pictograph of an I beam, like the kind that is used in heavy construction work on buildings and bridges, gives us the character for <strong>craft </strong>in general. [3]<br></div><div><br></div><div>* As a primitive element, the key word retains the meaning of <em>craft </em>and also takes on the related meanings of <em>I beam</em> and <em>artificial</em>.</div></div>
左|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning:&nbsp;<strong>Left</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>By combining the primitive and the kanji of the last two frames and reading the results, we get:<em> by one’s side . . . craft</em>. Conveniently, the <strong>left </strong>has traditionally been considered the “sinister” side, where dark and occult <em>crafts </em>are cultivated. Note how the second stroke droops over to the <strong>left </strong>and is longer than the first. [5]</div></div>
右|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning:&nbsp;<strong>Right</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>When thinking of the key word <strong>right</strong>, in order to avoid confusion with the previous frame, take advantage of the double-meaning here, too. Imagine a little <em>mouth </em>hanging down by your <em>side</em>—like a little voice of conscience—telling you the <strong>right </strong>thing to do. Here the second stroke should reach out to the <strong>right </strong>and be drawn slightly longer than the first. [5]</div></div>
有|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning:&nbsp;<strong>Possess</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The picture here is of someone with a slab of <em>flesh </em>dangling <em>by the side</em>, perhaps from a belt or rope tied around the waist. Think of it as an evil spirit in <strong>possession </strong>of one’s soul, who can be exorcized only by allowing fresh <em>flesh </em>to hang <em>by one’s side</em> until it begins to putrefy and stink so bad that the demon departs. Take careful note of the stroke order. [6]</div></div>
賄|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning:&nbsp;<strong>Bribe</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>To the left we have the primitive for a <em>shellfish</em>, and to the right the kanji we just learned for <em>possess</em>. Keep the connotation of the last frame for the word <em>possess</em>, and now expand your image of <em>shells </em>to include the ancient value they had as money (a usage that will come in very helpful later on). Now one who is <em>possessed </em>by <em>shells </em>is likely to abandon any higher principles to acquire more and more wealth. These are the easiest ones to <strong>bribe </strong>with a few extra shells. [13]</div></div>
貢|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning:&nbsp;<strong>Tribute</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>A <strong>tribute </strong>has a kind of double-meaning in English: honor paid freely and <em>money </em>collected by coercion. Simply because a ruler bestows a noble name on a deed is hardly any consolation to the masses who must part with their hard-earned <em>money</em>. Little wonder that this ancient <em>craft </em>of getting <em>money </em>by calling it a <strong>tribute </strong>has given way to a name closer to how it feels to those who pay it: a tax. [10]</div></div>
項|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning:&nbsp;<strong>Paragraph</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>To the right we see a <em>head </em>and to the left an element that means <em>craft</em>. When we think of a <strong>paragraph</strong>, we immediately think of a <em>heading </em>device to break a text into parts. (Think of the elaborate <em>heads </em>often seen at the start of medieval manuscripts and the task becomes easier still.) Just where and how to do it belongs to the writer’s <em>craft</em>. Hence, we define <strong>paragraphing </strong>as the “<em>heading craft</em>” to remember this character. [12]</div></div>
刀|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning:&nbsp;<strong>Sword</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Although this kanji no longer looks very much like a <strong>sword</strong>, it does have some resemblance to the handle of the <strong>sword</strong>. This is to our advantage, in that it helps us make a distinction between two primitive elements based on this kanji. [2] <br></div><div><br></div><div>* In the form of the kanji, this primitive means a <em>dagger</em>. When it appears to the right of another element, it is commonly stretched out like this ⺉ and takes the sense of a great and flashing <em>saber</em>, a meaning it gets from a character we shall learn later (FRAME 1801).</div></div>
刃|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning:&nbsp;<strong>Blade</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Think of using a <em>dagger </em>as a razor <strong>blade</strong>, and it shouldn’t be hard to imagine cutting yourself. See the little <em>drop </em>of blood clinging to the <strong>blade</strong>? [3]</div></div>
切|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning:&nbsp;<strong>Cut</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>To the right we see the <em>dagger </em>and next to it the number <em>seven </em>whose primitive meaning we <em>decided </em>would be diced (FRAME 7). It is hard to think of <strong>cutting </strong>anything with a knife without imagining one of those skillful Japanese chefs. Only let us say that he has had too much to drink at a party, grabs a <em>dagger </em>lying on the mantelpiece and starts dicing up everything in sight, starting with the hors d’oeuvres and going on to the furniture and the carpets…. [4]</div></div>
召|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning:&nbsp;<strong>Seduce</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>A sword or <em>dagger </em>posed over a <em>mouth </em>is how the character for “beckoning” is written. The related but less tame key word <strong>seduce </strong>was chosen because it seemed to fit better with the—how shall we put it?— Freudian implications of the kanji. (Observe if you will that it is not sure whether the long slender object is <strong>seducing </strong>the small round one or vice versa.) [5] <br></div><div><br></div><div>* The primitive meaning remains the same: <em>seduce</em>. Just be sure to associate it with a very concrete image.</div></div>
昭|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning:&nbsp;<strong>Shining</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Let the key word suggest <strong>shining </strong>one’s shoes, the purpose of which is to <em>seduce </em>the sun down on them for all to see. [9]</div></div>
則|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning:&nbsp;<strong>Rule</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The character depicts a <em>clam </em>alongside a great and flashing <em>saber</em>. Think of digging for <em>clams </em>in an area where there are gaming <strong>rules </strong>governing how large a find has to be before you can keep it. So you take your trusty <em>saber</em>, which you have carefully notched like a yardstick, crack open a <em>clam</em>, and then measure the poor little beastie to see if it is as long as the <strong>rules </strong>say it has to be. [9]</div></div>
副|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning:&nbsp;<strong>Vice</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The key word <strong>vice </strong>has the sense of someone secondin-command. The great and flashing <em>saber </em>to the right (its usual location, so you need not worry about where to put it from now on) and the <em>wealth </em>on the left combine to create an image of dividing one’s property to give a share to one’s <strong>vice</strong>-<em>wealth</em>holder. [11]</div></div>
別|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning:&nbsp;<strong>Separate</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>In the Old East, the samurai and his <em>saber </em>were never <strong>separated</strong>. They were constant companions, like the cowboy of the Old West and his six-shooter. This character depicts what must have been the height of <strong>separation</strong>-anxiety for a samurai: to be <em>bound up</em> <em>with a rope</em> and unable to get at his <em>saber </em>leaning only a few feet away from him. Look at that <em>mouth </em>bellowing out for shame and sorrow! Note the order in which the element for tied up is written—just as it had been with the character for <em>ten thousand</em>. [7]</div></div>
丁|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning:&nbsp;<strong>Street</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The picture here is of a <strong>street </strong>sign on a long pole: Hollywood and Vine, if you please, or any <em>street </em>that immediately conjures up the image of a <strong>street </strong>sign to you. [2]<br></div><div><br></div><div>* Used as a primitive, we change the meaning of the key word and take the shape to signify a <em>nail </em>or a <em>spike</em>. Should it happen, on reviewing, that you find the pictographs get jumbled, then think of jerking a <em>street </em>sign out of the ground and using it as a <em>nail</em> to repair your garage roof.</div></div>
町|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning:&nbsp;<strong>Town</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><em>Street </em>signs standing at the corner of the <em>rice fields</em> depict the <strong>town </strong>limits. (Remember what was said earlier: when used as a primitive, a kanji may either take its primitive meaning or revert to the original meaning of its key word.) [7]</div></div>
可|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning:&nbsp;<strong>Can</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><em></em>Remember the story about the “Little Engine that <strong>Could</strong>” when you hear this key word, and the rest is simple. See the determined little locomotive huffing and puffing up the mountain—”I think I <strong>can</strong>, I think I <strong>can</strong>...”—spitting railroad <em>spikes </em>out of its <em>mouth </em>as it chews up the line to the top. [5]</div></div>
頂|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>Place on the head</b>.</div><div><br></div><div><em></em>The key word is actually a formal metaphor meaning “humble acceptance.” Reading off the two primitive elements in the order of their writing, we have: <em>nail </em>. . . <em>head</em>. As in “hitting the <em>nail </em>on the <em>head</em>.” Now one presumes that most people can handle metaphors, but if you were to run into a dimwit working in a hardware store who only knew the literal meaning of things, and were to ask him, in your best Japanese, to<strong> place on your head</strong> a nail, he might miss the point and cause you considerable torment. [11]</div></div>
子|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>Child</b>.</div><div><br></div><div><em></em>This kanji is a pictograph of a <strong>child </strong>wrapped up in one of those handy cocoons that Japanese mothers fix to their backs to carry around young <strong>children </strong>who cannot get around by themselves. The first stroke is like a wee head popping out for air; the second shows the body and legs all wrapped up; and the final stroke shows the arms sticking out to cling to the mother’s neck. [3]<br></div><div><br></div><div>* As a primitive, the meaning of <em>child </em>is retained, though you might imagine a little older <em>child</em>, able to run around and get into more mischief.</div></div>
孔|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>Cavity</b>.</div><div><br></div><div><em></em>Probably the one thing most <em>children </em>fear more than anything else is the dentist’s chair. Once a <em>child </em>has seen a dentist holding the x-rays up to the light and heard that ominous word <strong>cavity</strong>, even though it is not likely to know that the word means “hole” until it is much older, it will not be long before those two syllables get associated with the drill and that row of shiny <em>hooks </em>the dentist uses to torture people who are too small to fight back. [4]</div></div>
了|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Complete</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Learn this character by returning to FRAME 99 and the image given there. The only difference is that the “arms” have been left off (actually, only tucked inside). Thus a <em>child </em>with its arms wrapped up into the back-sack is the picture of a job successfully <strong>completed</strong>. [2]</div></div>
女|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Woman</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>You have probably seen somewhere the form of a squatting <strong>woman </strong>drawn behind this character, with two legs at the bottom, two arms (the horizontal line) and the head poking out the top. A little farfetched, until you draw the character and feel the grace and flow of the three simple strokes. Remembering the kanji is easy; being able to write it beautifully is another thing. [3]</div></div>
好|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Fond</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The phrase “to be <strong>fond </strong>of someone” has a natural gentleness about it, and lends a tenderness to the sense of touching by giving us the related term “to <strong>fondle</strong>.” The character likens it to a <em>woman</em> <strong>fondling</strong> her <em>child</em>. [6]</div></div>
如|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Likeness</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Pardon me if I revert to the venerable old Dr. Freud again, but his eye for symbolism is often helpful to appreciate things that more earthy imaginations once accepted more freely but that we have learned to cover over with a veneer of etiquette. For instance, the fact that things like the <em>mouth </em>of a cave served as natural ritual substitutes for the opening through which a <em>woman </em>gives birth. Hence, in order to be reborn as an adult, one may have to pass through the psychological equivalent of the womb, that is, something that bears a <strong>likeness </strong>to the <em>opening </em>of the <em>woman </em>from whom you were born. [6]</div></div>
母|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Mama</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Look closely at this kanji and you will find the outline of the kanji for <em>woman </em>in it, the second stroke of which has been expanded to make space for the two breasts that make her a <strong>mama</strong>. Likening this sound to a baby nursing at its mother’s breast has afforded some scholars of comparative linguistics a way to explain the presence of the same word across a wide range of language-groups. [5]</div><div><br></div><div>* As a primitive we shall add the meaning of <em>breasts </em>in accord with the explanation given above. Take careful note of the fact that the form is altered slightly when this kanji serves as a&nbsp;primitive, the final two dots joining together to form a longer stroke. An example follows in the next frame.</div></div>
貫|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Pierce</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>If one is asked to think of associations for the word <strong>pierce</strong>, among the first to come to mind is that of <strong>piercing </strong>one’s ears to hold earrings, a quite primitive form of self-mutilation that has survived into the 21st century. The kanji here is read, top to bottom: <em>mama </em>. . . <em>oyster</em>. All you need to do is imagine <strong>piercing</strong> an ear so that it can hold a motherof-pearl (actually, a <em>mama</em>-of-pearl) you have just wrested from an <em>oyster</em>. [11]</div></div>
兄|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>Elder brother</b>.</div><div><br></div><div>By now kanji like this one should “look like” something to you even though it is more of an “ideogram” than a “pictograph.” The large <em>mouth </em>on top and the <em>human legs</em> below almost jump off the page as a caricature of <strong>elder brother</strong>, the one with the big <em>mouth </em>(or if you prefer a kinder image, the one who “has the say” among all the children). [5]</div><div><br></div><div>* As a primitive this character will take the meaning of <em>teenager</em>, in accord with the familiar image of the big <em>mouth </em>and the gangling, clumsy <em>legs</em>.</div></div>
呪|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>Curse</b>.</div><div><br></div><div>For some reason, the inventor of this kanji associated a <strong>curse </strong>with the <em>mouth </em>of an <em>elder brother</em>. I leave it&nbsp;to you to decide if he is on the giving or receiving end of the sorcery. [8]</div></div>
克|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>Overcome</b>.</div><div><br></div><div>In this frame we get a chance to use the kanji we just learned in its primitive meaning of <em>teenager</em>. The <em>needle</em> on top indicates one of the major problems confronting the <em>teenager </em>growing up in today’s world: drugs. Many of them will fall under the shadow of the <em>needle </em>at some time during those tender years, but only when a whole generation rises up and decides that “We Shall <strong>Overcome</strong>” the plague, will the <em>needle </em>cease to hang over their heads, as it does in this character. [7]</div></div>
小|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Little</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The sense of <strong>little </strong>in this character is not the same as “a <strong>little </strong>bit.” That meaning comes in the next frame. Here little means “small” or “tiny.” The image is one of three <strong>little</strong> <em>drops</em>, the first of which (the one in the middle) is written larger so that the kanji has some shape to it. The point of writing it three times is to rub the point in: <strong>little</strong>, <strong>little</strong>, nothing but <strong>little</strong>. [3]</div><div><br></div><div>*&nbsp;The primitive of the same shape keeps the same meaning. Written above a horizontal line, its form is slightly altered, the last two strokes turning inwards like this: ??.</div></div>
少|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Few</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>First we need to look at the fourth stroke, the <em>eyedropper </em>at the bottom that leans towards the left. This happens because a single, isolated <em>drop </em>will&nbsp;NEVER appear beneath its relative primitive in its normal size, for fear it would drop off and get lost. As for the meaning, let the <em>eyedropper </em>indicate a further belittling of what is already <em>little</em>—thus making it a <strong>few </strong>of something <em>little</em>. [4]</div></div>
大|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Large</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Here we have a simple pictograph of a person, taking up the space of an entire character and giving it the sense of <strong>large</strong>. It should not be too hard to locate the two legs and outstretched arms. [3]</div><div><br></div><div>*&nbsp;As a primitive, we need a different meaning, since the element representing the human person will come up later. Therefore, this shape will become a <em>large dog</em> or, if you prefer, a <em>St. Bernard dog</em>. In FRAME 253 we will explain why this choice was made.</div></div>
多|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Many</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>“<strong>Many </strong>moons ago,” begins much of Amerindian folklore—a colorful way of saying “Once upon a time” and a great deal of help for remembering this kanji. Here we have two <em>moons </em>(three of them would take us back to the beginning of time, which is further than we want to go), lacking the final stroke because they are partially hidden behind the clouds of time. [6]</div></div>
夕|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Evening</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Just as the word <strong>evening </strong>adds a touch of formality or romanticism to the ordinary word “night,” so the kanji for <strong>evening </strong>takes the ordinary looking <em>moon </em>in the night sky and has a cloud pass over it (as we saw in the last frame). [3]</div><div><br></div><div>*&nbsp;The primitive keeps the same meaning and connotation as the kanji.</div></div>
汐|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Eventide (Event?)</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>In the next lesson we will meet the character for morning-<em>tide</em> and the element for <em>drops of water</em>. Meantime we have a perfect blend of picture and idea in this kanji to play on the English word for nightfall, <strong>eventide</strong>: <em>drops of water</em> inching their way up the shore in the <em>evening</em>. [6]</div></div>
外|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Outside</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>On the left, the primitive for <em>evening</em>, and on the right, that for the <em>magic wand</em>. Now, as every magician worth his abracadabra knows, bringing your <em>magic wand</em> out into the <em>evening </em>air makes your magic much more powerful than if you were to stay indoors. Hence, <em>evening </em>and <em>magic wand</em> takes you naturally <strong>outside</strong>. [5]</div></div>
名|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Name</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Perhaps you have heard of the custom, still preserved in certain African tribes, of a father creeping into the tent or hut of his newborn child on the night of the&nbsp;child’s birth, to whisper into its ear the <strong>name </strong>he has chosen for it, before making his choice public. It is an impressive <strong>naming </strong>custom and fits in tidily with the way this character is constructed: <em>evening </em>. . . <em>mouth</em>. At <em>evening</em> time, a <em>mouth </em>pronounces the <strong>name </strong>that will accompany one throughout life. [6]</div></div>
石|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Stone</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>With a <em>mouth </em>under a <em>cliff</em>, what else could we have here but the entrance to a secret cavern, before which a great <strong>stone </strong>has been rolled so that none may enter. Perhaps it is the hiding place where Ali Baba and his band of thieves have stored their treasures, in which case that magic word known to every school child who ever delighted over the tales of the <em>Arabian Nights</em> should be enough to push the <strong>stone</strong> aside. But take care—the <em>cliff </em>is steep, and one slip will send you tumbling down into the ravine below. [5] This is the one and only time that the second stroke in <em>cliff </em>will reach over to the middle of the horizontal stroke. If you think of the edge jutting outwards (in keeping with the story above), the problem should be taken care of.</div><div><br></div><div>*&nbsp;The stone is a quite common primitive element,&nbsp;which is not restricted to great boulders but used of stones or rocks of any size or shape.</div></div>
肖|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Resemblance</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The word <strong>resemblance </strong>should suggest, among other things, a son’s <strong>resemblance </strong>to his father. A “chip off the old block” is the way we often put it, but the character is more simple. It speaks of a <em>little </em>bit of <em>flesh</em>. [7]<br></div><div><br></div><div>*&nbsp;When used as a primitive, the sense of <em>resemblance</em> is replaced by that of <em>spark </em>or <em>candle</em>. (If you want an explanation: the kanji for <em>moon </em>also carries a secondary sense of <em>fire</em>, which we omitted because we are keeping that meaning for other primitives.)</div></div>
硝|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Nitrate</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The word <strong>nitrate </strong>should immediately suggest a beaker of <strong>nitric </strong>acid, which, as every high-school chemistry student knows, can eat its way through some pretty tough substances. Here we imagine pouring it over a <em>rock </em>and watching the <em>sparks </em>fly as it bores a hole through the rock. [12]</div></div>
砕|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Smash</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>We begin with the two elements on the right, <em>baseball </em>and <em>needle</em>. Since they will be coming together from time to time, let us give the two of them the sense of a <em>game of cricket</em> in which a <em>needle </em>is laid across the wicket. Then imagine using a <em>rock </em>for a ball. A <strong>smash </strong>hit would probably splinter&nbsp;the bat in all directions, and a <strong>smashing </strong>pitch would do the same with the <em>needle </em>wicket. [9]</div></div>
砂|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Sand</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Good <strong>sand </strong>for beaches has few or no <em>stones</em> in it. That means that all of us whose feet have been spoiled by too much time in shoes don’t have to watch our step as we cavort about. [9]</div></div>
妬|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Jealous</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>It should not be hard to leap from the key word to the image of a <em>woman </em>who is <strong>jealous </strong>of the <em>rock</em> that another <em>woman </em>is sporting on the third finger of her left hand. [8]</div></div>
削|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Plane</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Long before the invention of the carpenter’s <strong>plane</strong>, people used knives and machetes (or here, <em>sabers</em>) to smooth out their woodwork. If you have ever seen the process, you will have been amazed at the speed and agility with which the adept can <strong>plane</strong> a hunk of wood into shape. Indeed, you can almost see the <em>sparks</em> fly from their <em>sabers</em>. [9]</div></div>
光|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Ray</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>There are really only 2 primitives here, <em>little </em>and <em>human legs</em>. The 4th stroke that separates them is added for reasons of aesthetics. (If that doesn’t make&nbsp;sense, try writing the kanji without it and see how ugly the results look, even to your beginner’s eye.) Now if you have wondered what those little particles of “dust” are that dance around in the light-<strong>rays </strong>that come through the window and fall on your desk, try imagining them as <em>little </em>and disembodied <em>human legs</em>, and you should have no trouble with this character. [6]</div></div>
太|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Plump</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>“Plump” is one of those delightful English words that almost sound like their meaning. No sooner do you hear it than you think of a round and ample-bodied person falling into a sofa like a <em>large drop</em> of oil plopping into a fishbowl—kerrrr-<strong>plump</strong>! [4]</div></div>
器|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Utensil</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The picture in this kanji is not a pleasant one. It shows a large and fluffy <em>St. Bernard dog</em> stretched out on a table all stuffed and stewed and garnished with vegetables, its paws in the air and an apple in its mouth. At each corner of the table sits an eager but empty <em>mouth</em>, waiting for the <strong>utensils </strong>to arrive so the feast can begin. [15]</div></div>
臭|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Stinking</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>This character is a bit friendlier to the animal world than the last one. Our friend the <em>St. Bernard</em> is alive and well, its <em>nose </em>in the air sniffing suspiciously after something <strong>stinking </strong>somewhere or other. [9]</div></div>
嗅|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Sniff</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>You have seen those scratch-’n-<strong>sniff </strong>advertisements for perfumes. This one is for a <em>mouth</em>wash that replaces one <em>stinking </em>odor with another. [12]</div></div>
妙|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Exquisite</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The primitive for <em>woman </em>is on the left (there and at the bottom of another primitive is where you will always find her), and to the right the element for <em>few</em>. When we refer to a <em>woman </em>as <strong>exquisite</strong>, we mean to praise her as the sort of person we meet but <em>few </em>and far between. If you are interested in etymologies, it might help to recall that the Latin phrase lying at the root of the English word <strong>exquisite </strong>carries this same sense of “seeking out” the rare from the ordinary. [7]</div></div>
省|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Focus</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>When we think of <strong>focusing </strong>on something, we usually take it in a metaphorical sense, though the literal sense is not far behind. It means to block out what is nonessential in order to fix our <em>eye</em> on a <em>few </em>important matters. The kanji suggests picking up a <em>few </em>things and holding them before one’s <em>eye </em>in order to <strong>focus </strong>on them better. [9]</div></div>
厚|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Thick</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>When we refer to someone as <strong>thick</strong>-skinned or <strong>thick</strong>-headed, we are usually quick to add—even if only under our breath—something about their upbringing. Perhaps it is because deep down we cherish the belief that by nature people are basically tender and sensitive. Be that as it may, the Japanese character for <strong>thick </strong>depicts a <em>child </em>abandoned out on the wild <em>cliffs</em>, exposed to the heat of the <em>sun</em>, and thus doomed to develop a head and skin as <strong>thick </strong>as the parent who left it there. [9]</div></div>
奇|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>Strange</b>.</div><div><br></div><div>The elements we are given to work with here are <em>St. Bernard dog</em> and <em>can</em>. Lots of phrases pop to mind to attach these words to the key word, but they end up too abstract because of the word <em>can</em>. It is important in such cases (and there will be plenty of them as we go along) to stick closely to the elements, in this case, <em>mouth </em>and <em>nails</em>. Now all we need do is create a fictitious “<strong>Strange </strong>But True” column in the Sunday funnies, featuring a <em>St. Bernard</em> whose <em>mouth </em>has been <em>nailed </em>shut because he was hitting the brandy keg around his neck too hard. [8]</div></div>
川|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>Stream</b>.</div><div><br></div><div>We have taken the image of a river <strong>stream </strong>over into English to describe things that fall down in straight lines, or ripple along in lines. All of this is more than evident in the kanji given here, a pictograph of a <strong>stream</strong>. [3]</div><div><br></div><div>*&nbsp;As a primitive, this character adds to the meaning of <em>stream </em>the more vivid image of a <em>flood</em>. Note, however, that there are certain small changes in the writing of the element, depending on where it appears relative to other elements:<br></div><div>on the left, it is written 川 <br></div><div>on the top, it is written ⼮ <br></div><div>on the bottom, it is written </div></div>
州|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>State</b>.</div><div><br></div><div>Here we see <em>drops </em>of land (little islets) rising up out of a <em>stream</em>, creating a kind of sandbar or breakwater.&nbsp;Ever wonder how the <strong>state</strong>-line is drawn between <strong>states </strong>separated by a river? If there were little <em>drops </em>of land as in the kanji, there’d be nothing to it. [6]</div></div>
順|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>Obey</b>.</div><div><br></div><div>In primitive language, this character would read <em>stream </em>. . . <em>head</em>. And that turns out to be convenient for remembering its meaning of <strong>obey</strong>. Either one <strong>obeys </strong>the person who is <em>head </em>of an organization or else <strong>obeys </strong>by following the <em>stream </em>of opinion (“current” practice, we call it). Both these senses come together in this kanji. [12].</div></div>
水|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>Water</b>.</div><div><br></div><div>This character, which looks a bit like a snowflake, is actually a pictograph of <strong>water</strong>—not any particular body of water or movement of water, but simply the generic name for <strong>water</strong>. Should you have any difficulty remembering it, simply think of a <em>walking stick</em> being dropped vertically into the <strong>water</strong>, sending <em>droplets</em> out in all four directions. Then all you need to learn is how to write it in proper order. [4]</div><div><br></div><div>*&nbsp;As a primitive, this character can keep its form, or it can be written with three drops to the left of another primitive, like this: ⺡. This latter, as we will see, is far more common.</div></div>
氷|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>Icicle</b>.</div><div><br></div><div>The appearance of the primitive for <em>water </em>in its full form tells us that we have something to do with <em>water </em>here. The extra <em>drop </em>to the left, added as a second stroke, changes the picture from a splash caused by a <em>walking stick </em>dropped into <em>water&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>to form an <strong>icicle</strong>. If it helps, when you hold an <strong>icicle </strong>up to the light, you can usually see little crystallizations of fivepointed stars inside of it, which is the shape we have in this kanji. [5]</div></div>
永|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>Eternity</b>.</div><div><br></div><div>This kanji also uses the full form of <em>water</em>, though its meaning seems to have nothing at all to do with <em>water</em>. Remember what William Blake said about seeing “infinity in a grain of sand and <strong>eternity </strong>in an hour”? Well, reading this character from top to bottom, we see “<strong>eternity </strong>in a <em>drop of water</em>.” [5]</div></div>
泉|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>Spring</b>.</div><div><br></div><div>Call to mind the image of a fresh, bubbling <strong>spring </strong>of <em>water</em>, and you will probably notice how the top of the <strong>spring </strong>you are thinking of, the part where the “bubbling” goes on, is all <em>white</em>. Happily, the <em>white </em>is just where it should be, at the top, and the <em>water </em>is at the bottom. [9]<br></div><div><br></div><div>* We will keep this image of a <em>spring </em>when using this kanji as a primitive, but not without first drawing attention to a slight change that distinguishes the primitive from the kanji. The final 4 strokes (the element for <em>water</em>) are abbreviated to the three small <em>drops </em>that we learned earlier as the kanji for <em>little</em>, giving us: .</div></div>
腺|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Gland</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Dig into your <em>flesh </em>and pull out a lymph <strong>gland</strong>. Now give it a squeeze and watch a <em>spring </em>of lymph spout out of it. [13]</div></div>
原|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Meadow</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Though the kanji is broad enough to embrace both meanings, the <strong>meadow</strong> you should imagine here is not a flatland plain but a mountain <strong>meadow </strong>in the Austrian Alps. (Perhaps the opening scene of “The Sound of Music” will help.) Simply think of little <em>springs </em>bubbling up across the <strong>meadow </strong>to form a sort of path that leads you right to the brink of a precipitous <em>cliff</em>. Now if you can see Schwester Maria skipping along merrily, dodging in and out of the <em>springs</em>, and then falling headlong over the <em>cliff</em>, you have a ridiculous story that should help fix this kanji in memory. [10]</div></div>
願|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Petition</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>A <em>meadow </em>and a <em>head </em>are all we are given to work with in the kanji for <strong>petition</strong>. Since the key word already suggests something like a formal request made of some higher power, let us imagine a gigantic Wizard-of-Oz <em>head </em>located in the middle of the flowery <em>meadow </em>we used in the last frame. Then just picture people kneeling hopefully before it, <strong>petitioning </strong>for whatever it is they want. (The&nbsp;scarecrow wanted brains, the lion, courage, and the tin man a heart. What about you?) [19]</div></div>
泳|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Swim</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The primitive to the left, you will recall from FRAME 137, represents <em>water</em>. To the right, we see the kanji for <em>eternity</em>. Knowing how much children like <strong>swimming</strong>, what could be a better image of <em>eternal </em>bliss than an endless expanse of <em>water </em>to <strong>swim </strong>in without a care in the world? [8]</div></div>
沼|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Marsh</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Unlike the meadow with its cliffs, the <strong>marsh</strong>lands are low and near a source of <em>water </em>that feeds them until they get soggy through and through. Why certain land becomes <strong>marshy </strong>is probably due to the fact that it felt thirsty, and so tried its best to <em>seduce </em>the <em>water </em>over to its side. But, like most inordinate <em>seductions</em>, the last state of the victim is worse than the first. Hence the slushy <strong>marsh</strong>. [8]</div></div>
沖|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Open sea</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>This kanji could hardly be simpler. The key word <strong>open sea</strong> readily suggests being out <em>in </em>the <em>middle </em>of a great body of <em>water</em>. Thinking of it in this way should avoid confusion with the kanji for “open,” which we will meet later on. [7]</div></div>
汎|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Pan-</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The sense of the key word here is the “all-inclusive” we find in terms like “<strong>Pan</strong>-American Games.” (It is also the character used in mathematics for “partial” as in partial differentials, in case you are a math major and want to take your story in that direction.) Instead of a <em>water </em>sports event that brings together the best talent, think of a meet of the region’s most <em>mediocre </em>athletes, many of whom cannot even tread <em>water</em>. Now try to find a sponsor for the “<strong>Pan</strong>-Mediocre Water Sports Competition.” [6]</div></div>
江|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Creek</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Unlike the river, the ocean, the lake, and the pond, the <strong>creek </strong>is often no more then a dribble of <em>water </em>trickling down a small gully. While the geological history of the larger bodies of <em>water </em>is hard to surmise sometimes, all of us know from our childhood how <strong>creeks </strong>are made. You probably even dug one or two in your time. All you need to do is find a mainstream of <em>water </em>somewhere and dig a little path into dry land. The <strong>creek </strong>is thus a lesson in watercraft, as this kanji would agree. [6]</div></div>
汰|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Cleanse</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>This character can mean both to <strong>cleanse </strong>and to make dirty. We will choose the latter and imagine someone who is displeasingly <em>plump </em>going to a skinny spa whose medicinal <em>waters </em>promise to <strong>cleanse </strong>him of his unwanted corpulence. Picture him sitting in the spa as the pounds melt away, leaving a greasy scum on top of the <em>water</em>. [7]</div></div>
汁|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Soup</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>To make <strong>soup</strong>, one begins with <em>water </em>and then starts adding things to it, often leftovers from the icebox. This is how the thick <strong>soup </strong>or stew called “seven-in-one” is made. This kanji does it three better, giving us a <em>ten</em>-ingredient <strong>soup</strong>. [5]</div></div>
沙|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Grains of sand</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>We have already learned the kanji for <em>sand </em>(FRAME 122), so let’s use it to remember the character for <strong>grains of sand</strong>. Instead of the “few stones” that make for nice sand, here we have a <em>few drops of water</em>, one for each <strong>grain of sand</strong>—a beach in perfect ecological balance. [7]</div></div>
潮|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Tide</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Before we get to explaining this character, take a look at it and see if you can figure out the primitive elements on your own…. On the left is the <em>water</em>— that much is easy. On the right we have only one primitive, the kanji for <em>morning </em>learned back in FRAME 53. See how an apparently complex kanji falls apart neatly into manageable pieces?<br></div><div>To get the meaning of the key word <strong>tide</strong>, just think of it in connection with the character for <em>eventide </em>that we learned back in FRAME 115. Here we have the <em>morning</em>-<strong>tide</strong>, its complement.<br></div><div>By the way, if you missed the question about the number of primitives, it is probably because you&nbsp;forgot what we said earlier about kanji becoming primitives, independently of the pieces that make them up. As a rule, look for the largest kanji you can write and proceed from there to primitives stranded on their own. [15]</div></div>
源|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Source</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>With the advice of the last frame in mind, it is easy to see <em>water </em>and <em>meadow </em>in this character for <strong>source</strong>. Both in its etymology (it has a common parent with the word “surge”) and in popular usage, <strong>source </strong>suggests the place <em>water </em>comes from. In this kanji, it is under the <em>meadow</em>, where we just saw it breaking the surface in those bubbly little springs. [13]</div></div>
活|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Lively</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>When we speak of a <strong>lively </strong>personality or a <strong>lively </strong>party, we immediately think of a lot of chatter. This kanji depicts the idea of <strong>lively </strong>by having <em>tongues </em>babble and splash around like flowing <em>water</em>. [9]</div></div>
消|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Extinguish</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Among the many things <em>water </em>is useful for is <strong>extinguishing </strong>fires, and that is just what we have here. First of all, take the <em>water </em>at the left as the <em>drops of water</em> that are used to depict <em>water </em>in general. In the best of all possible worlds, the most efficient way to <strong>extinguish </strong>a fire would be to see that each <em>drop of water</em> hits one <em>spark </em>of the conflagration. An unthinkable bit of utopian fire&nbsp;fighting, you say to yourself, but helpful for assigning this key word its primitives. [10]</div></div>
況|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>But of course</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>This key word is a connector used to link contrasting phrases and sentences together with much the same flavor as the English phrase <strong>but of course</strong>. Just picture yourself ready to go off on your first date as a <em>teenager</em>, and having your mother grill you about your manners and ask you embarrassing questions about your hygiene. “Did you have a good shower?” “<strong>But of course</strong>…,” you reply, annoyed. So <em>water </em>and <em>teenager</em> combine to give us <strong>but of course</strong>. [8]</div></div>
河|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>River</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The character in this frame represents a step up from the <em>stream </em>we met in FRAME 134; it is a full-sized <strong>river</strong>. The <em>water </em>to the left tells us what we are dealing with, and the <em>can </em>at the right tells us that our “little engine that <em>could</em>” has now become amphibious and is chugging down the Mighty Mississip’ like a regular riverboat. [8]</div></div>
泊|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Overnight</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>When you stop at an inn for an <strong>overnight </strong>rest, all you expect is a bit of <em>water </em>for a wash and a set of clean <em>white </em>sheets to wrap your weary bones in. [8]</div></div>
湖|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Lake</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><em>Water </em>. . . <em>old </em>. . . <em>flesh</em>. You have heard of legends of people being abandoned in the mountains when they had become too <em>old </em>to work. Well, here is a legend about people being set adrift in the <em>waters </em>of a stormy <strong>lake </strong>because their <em>flesh </em>had gotten too <em>old </em>to bear the burdens of life. [12]</div></div>
測|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Fathom (noun: unit if measurement, verb: to understand or comprehend something deeply or thoroghly)</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><em></em>Connoting the measurement of the depth of <em>water</em>, the key word <strong>fathom </strong>begins with the <em>water</em> primitive. To its right, we see the compound-primitive for <em>rule </em>(FRAME 92) which we learned in the sense of a “ruler” or “measure.” Hence, when we r<em>ule water</em> we <strong>fathom </strong>it. What could be simpler? But be careful; its simplicity is deceptive. Be sure to picture yourself <strong>fathoming </strong>a body of <em>water </em>several hundred feet deep by using a <em>ruler </em>of gargantuan proportions. [12]</div></div>
土|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Soil</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><em></em>I don’t like it any more than you do, but this kanji is not the pictograph it is trumped up to be: a mound of <strong>soil </strong>piled on the ground. All I can recommend is that you memorize it as it is. Anyway, it will be occurring with such frequency that you have almost no chance of forgetting it, even if you try. [3]</div><div><br></div><div>* As a primitive, the sense of <em>soil </em>is extended to that of <em>ground </em>because of its connection with the kanji for the same (FRAME 554). From there it also takes the added meanings of <em>dirt </em>and <em>land</em>.</div></div>
吐|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Spit</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><em></em>We have here a rather small <em>mouth </em>(it is always compressed when set on the left) next to a much larger piece of <em>dirt</em>. It is not hard to imagine what you might do if you got a <em>mouth </em>full of <em>dirt</em>. As least I know what I would do: <strong>spit </strong>it out as fast and far as I could! [6]</div></div>
圧|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Pressure</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><em></em>One of the things that causes the erosion of <em>soil </em>is the excessive <strong>pressure </strong>of the top<em>soil</em> on the lower <em>soil</em>. This can be caused by any number of things from heavy rainfall to heavy buildings to the absence of sufficient deep-rooted vegetation to hold the layers together. Here we see a steep <em>cliff </em>without a tree in sight. The slightest <strong>pressure </strong>on it will cause a landslide, which, with a little help from your imagination, you will be able to see happening in this character. [5]</div></div>
埼|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Cape</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><em></em>The <strong>cape </strong>pictured here is a jut of <em>land </em>like <strong>Cape </strong>Cod. The <em>soil </em>on the left tells us we have to do with <em>land</em>, and the <em>strange </em>on the right tells us it is a <strong>cape </strong>where unusual things go on. Put a haunted house on it, an eerie sky overhead, and a howling wind rustling through the trees, and you have yourself a picture of <strong>Cape </strong><em>Strange </em>(or, if you prefer, Cape Odd). [11]</div></div>
垣|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Hedge</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><em></em>The <strong>hedge </strong>depicted in this frame is not your ordinary run-of-the-suburbs shrubbery, but the miraculous <strong>hedge </strong>of briar roses that completely <em>spanned </em>the castle <em>grounds </em>in which Sleeping Beauty lay for a hundred years, so that none but her predestined beloved could find his way through it. [9]</div></div>
填|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Inlay (decorative technique used in woodworking and other crafts)</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><em></em>When we hear the word <strong>inlay</strong>, we usually think of setting precious stones in pieces of jewelery, but the primitive elements here suggest <em>truth </em>being <strong>inlaid </strong>in the <em>soil</em>. You might think instead of the cosmic wisdom that <strong>inlaid </strong>the <em>truth </em>of the universe in the stuff of the earth. [13]</div></div>
圭|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Squared jewel</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><em></em>Now I am going to do something unusual. The character in this frame is going to get one meaning and the primitive another, with no relation at all between the two. In time, I hope you will see how helpful this is. The kanji key word, <strong>squared jewel</strong>, depicts a mammoth precious stone, several feet high, made by piling up large heaps of <em>soil </em>on top of one another. Not something you would want to present your betrothed on your wedding day, but a good image for remembering this rare character, used chiefly in personal names nowadays. [6]<br></div><div><br></div><div>* As a primitive, we shall use this character to&nbsp;mean <em>ivy</em>, that creepy vegetation that covers the surface of the <em>ground </em>to form a sort of “second” <em>ground </em>that can get somewhat tricky to walk on without tripping.</div></div>
封|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Seal</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><em></em>Think of the key word <strong>seal </strong>as referring to a letter you have written and are preparing to close. Instead of using the traditional wax <strong>seal</strong>, you <em>glue </em>a sprig of <em>ivy </em>on the outside. In this way the elements <em>ivy </em>and <em>glue </em>give you a curious and memorable way to <strong>seal </strong>your secret letters. [9]</div></div>
涯|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Horizon</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><em></em>After seeing a constant <strong>horizon </strong>of <em>water</em>, <em>water </em>everywhere for months at sea, could there be anything more delightful to the eyes than to look astern and see the <em>ivy</em>-clad <em>cliffs </em>of land on a new <strong>horizon</strong>? Of course, you’d need the eyes of a stellar telescope to recognize that the vegetation was in fact <em>ivy</em>, but the phrase “<em>ivy</em>-clad <em>cliffs</em>” has such a nice ring to it that we won’t worry about such details. [11]</div></div>
寺|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Buddhist temple</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><em></em>You have heard of people “attaching” themselves to a particular sect? Here is your chance to take that metaphor literally and imagine some fellow walking into a <strong>Buddhist temple</strong> with a fervent resolve to attach himself to the place. Since there is plenty of unused <em>land </em>around the precincts, he simply picks out a suitable patch, brushes the soles of his feet&nbsp;with <em>glue</em>, steps down firmly, and so joins the <strong>Buddhist temple</strong> as a “permanent member.” [6]</div></div>
時|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Time</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><em></em>“What is <strong>time</strong>?” asked St. Augustine in his memoirs. “Ask me not, and I know. Ask me, and I cannot tell you.” Here we have the kanji’s answer to that perennial riddle. <strong>Time </strong>is a <em>sun </em>rising over a <em>Buddhist temple</em>. It sounds almost like a Zen kōan whose repetition might yield some deep secret to the initiated. At any rate, imagining a monk seated in meditation pondering it might help us remember the character. [10]</div></div>
均|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Level</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><em></em>The <strong>level </strong>this key word refers to is not the carpenter’s tool but rather the even surface of a thing. It pictures <em>soil </em>being scooped up into a <em>ladle </em>and then made <strong>level </strong>(apparently because one is measuring <em>soil</em>). The excess <em>drops of soil</em> are brushed off the top, which accounts for the added <em>drop </em>at the <em>ladle’s</em> edge. [7]</div></div>
火|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Fire</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><em></em>Just as sitting before a <strong>fire </strong>enlivens the imagination and lets you see almost anything you want to in the flames, this kanji is so simple it lets you see almost any sort of <strong>fire </strong>you want to see. It no longer makes a good pictograph, but I invite you to take a pencil and paper and play with the form—first writing it as&nbsp;shown below and then adding lines here and there— to see what you can come up with. Everything from matchbooks to cigarette lighters to volcanic eruptions to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah have been found here. No doubt you, too, will find something interesting to bend your memory around these four simple strokes. [4]<br></div><div><br></div><div>*&nbsp;To avoid confusion later on, it is best to keep to the meaning of a <em>fireplace </em>(or <em>hearth</em>) or a raging <em>conflagration </em>like a forest fire for this kanji’s primitive meaning. Another primitive element for <em>fire</em>, based on this one, is written ⺣ and will mean <em>flames</em>, <em>cauldron</em>, <em>cooking fire</em>, or an <em>oven fire</em>.</div></div>
炎|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Inflammation</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><em></em>A <em>fire </em>belongs IN the <em>hearth</em>, not OVER it. When the <em>fire </em>spreads to the rest of the house, we have an <strong>inflamed </strong>house. And as with any <strong>inflammation</strong>— including those that attack our bodies—the danger is always that it might spread if not checked. This is the sense behind the reduplication of the element for <em>fire</em>, one atop the other [8]</div></div>
煩|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Anxiety</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><em></em>The existential condition of <strong>anxiety </strong>that arises from the inevitable frustration of our worldly passions is contained in this character. The <em>head </em>is set <em>afire</em>, causing deep torment of spirit (and a whopper of a headache). [13]</div></div>
淡|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Thin</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The primitives in this kanji read: <em>water </em>. . . <em>inflammation</em>. Taking <em>inflammation </em>in its medical sense, the first <em>water</em>-related <em>inflammation </em>that pops into mind is dehydration, the principal symptom of which is that it makes one shrivel up and look very, very <strong>thin</strong>. If that is hard to remember, try thinking it backwards: a very <strong>thin </strong>chap passes by and you imagine him suffering from (being <em>inflamed </em>with) dehydration (hence the element for <em>water</em>). [11]</div></div>
灯|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Lamp</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Since it is very hard to read by the <em>fireplace </em>without going blind from the flickering of the flames or burning up from the heat, our ancestors invented a way to <em>nail </em>down a bit of that <em>fire</em>, just enough to light up the text of their evening newspapers and no more. Voilà! The <strong>lamp</strong>. [6]</div></div>
畑|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Farm</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Looking at the primitives, a <em>fireplace </em>and a <em>rice field</em>, we find the essential ingredients for a <strong>farm</strong>: a warm <em>hearth </em>to sit by at night, and a well-plowed <em>field </em>to grow one’s crops in by day. [9]</div></div>
災|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Disaster</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Of all of nature’s <strong>disasters</strong>, this kanji picks out two of the worst: <em>floods </em>and <em>fires</em>. To recall the disposition of the elements, think of nature’s solution to nature’s&nbsp;own problem: a great <em>flood </em>pouring down over a great forest <em>fire</em>. [7]</div></div>
灰|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Ashes</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The kanji for <strong>ashes</strong> naturally includes the primitive for <em>fire</em>, or more specifically, a <em>fireplace</em>. Now what do you do with that bucket of <strong>ashes </strong>you have just cleaned out of the <em>fireplace</em>? You walk to the edge of a <em>cliff </em>and tip it upside down, watching as they are swept away in the wind like a swarm of gray mosquitoes. Thus the <em>fire</em>, once it has turned to <strong>ashes</strong>, ends up at the bottom of the <em>cliff</em>. [6]</div></div>
点|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Spot</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>If you look into the flickering of a <em>fire </em>for a long time and then turn aside, you will see <strong>spots </strong>before your eyes. Although nobody ever thought of such a thing before—as least as far as I know, they didn’t— imagine using those <strong>spots </strong>as a technique for <em>fortune-telling</em>. The old witch sits before her <em>cauldron </em>and watches the <strong>spots </strong>that show up when she turns to look at you, and from that tells your <em>fortune</em>. Think of it as a kind of <strong>spot</strong>-check on your future. [9]</div></div>
照|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Illuminate</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Although the range of possible meanings that the kanji for <strong>illuminate </strong>can have is about as rich as the connotations of the English word, we need to focus on just one of them: to make something <em>shine</em>. If you glaze a pot and put it into the <em>oven </em>to <em>fire </em>it, you in&nbsp;fact <em>illuminate </em>it. Hence the kanji for <strong>illuminate </strong>compares the kanji for <em>shining </em>with the primitive element for the <em>oven’s fire</em>. [13]</div></div>
魚|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Fish</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The composition of this kanji shows three elements, which we list in the order of their writing: <em>bound up</em> . . . <em>rice field</em> . . . <em>cooking fire</em>. Not much to work with at first sight. But we can join them together by thinking of a three-part story: first a <strong>fish </strong>is caught and <em>bound up</em> on a line with its unfortunate school-mates; when the fisherman gets home, he cuts off the head and tosses it, with the entrails, out into the <em>rice fields</em> for fertilizer; and the rest he sets in a skillet over a <em>cooking fire</em> for his supper. [11]</div></div>
漁|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Fishing</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>To the story we have just made about <em>fish</em>, this kanji for the profession of <strong>fishing </strong>adds yet another element BEFORE the others: namely the <em>water</em>, where the fish was happily at home before being caught, disemboweled, and eaten. Be sure to get a clear image of the <em>water </em>when you put it all together. [14]</div></div>
里|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Ri</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>That’s right—a <strong>ri</strong>. Don’t bother looking it up in your English dictionary; it’s a Japanese word for measuring distances. One <strong>ri </strong>is about 4 kilometers or 2.5 miles. The kanji depicts how the measure came to be used. Atop we see the <em>rice field</em>, and below the element for <em>land</em>. Those four sections you see in the <em>rice field</em> (and which we made mention of when first we introduced the character in FRAME 14) are actually measurements of <em>land</em>, much the same as farmsections in the United States have given us the notion of a “country mile.” The <em>land </em>division based on the size of a <em>rice field</em> is called a <strong>ri</strong>. [7]</div><div><br></div><div>*&nbsp;To get a more concrete primitive meaning for this kanji, we shall refer to it as a <em>computer</em>, a&nbsp;meaning deriving from the kanji for <em>logic</em>, which we will meet in Lesson 12.</div></div>
黒|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Black</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Like most things electrical, a <em>computer</em>, too, can overheat. Just imagine <em>flames </em>pouring out of it and charring the keyboard, the monitor, and your desk a sooty <strong>black </strong>color. [11]</div></div>
墨|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Black ink</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Besides meaning <strong>black ink</strong>, this kanji also appears in the word for an inked string that is pulled taut and snapped to mark a surface, much the same as one might used a chalked string. Here it is used to mark off the <em>dirt </em>with <em>black </em>lines for a football game (played, I presume, on a white field). [14]</div><div><br></div><div>!!! If we read the kanji from top to bottom: <em>black </em>... <em>dirt</em>. What looks like <em>black dirt</em>? As you figured out, it's <strong>black ink</strong>.</div></div>
鯉|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Carp</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>These are the same <strong>carp </strong>you see in Japanese “<strong>carp </strong>streamers.” Only here we find a small home <em>computer </em>or two strung on the line by a father anxious for his son not only to have the courage and determination of a <strong>carp </strong>swimming upstream, but also the efficiency and memory of a <em>computer</em>. Ugh. [18]</div></div>
量|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Quantity</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Think of <strong>quantity </strong>as having to do with measuring time and distance, and the rest is simple: you have a&nbsp;quantity of time in the new day that begins with <em>nightbreak</em>, and a quantity of distance in the rural ri. [12]</div></div>
厘|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Rin</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>No doubt you will find it in your heart to forgive me for forcing yet another Japanese word on you in this frame. It is not the last time it will happen in this book, but I can assure you they are used only when absolutely necessary.<br></div><div><br></div><div>One <strong>rin </strong>is equal to about 1/1000 of a yen—or rather was worth that much when it still made economic sense to mint them. While inflation took its toll on this kanji as a monetary unit, it survived with the not at all surprising sense of something “very, very tiny.”<br></div><div>The kanji shows a <em>cliff </em>with a <em>computer </em>under it, apparently because it has been pushed over into the abyss by someone fed up with the thing. The total market value of one home <em>computer </em>that has fallen over rock and bramble for several hundred feet: about one <strong>rin</strong>! [9]</div></div>
埋|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Bury</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>When we speak of <strong>burying </strong>something (or someone, for that matter), we usually mean putting them under <em>ground</em>. Only here, we are <strong>burying </strong>our beloved <em>computer </em>that has served us so well these past years. Behind us a choir chants the “Dies irae, dies illa” and there is much wailing and grief among the bystanders as they pass by to shovel a little <em>dirt </em>into what will be its final resting place. R.I.P. [10]</div></div>
同|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Same</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The primitives given are <em>one </em>and <em>mouth </em>under a <em>hood</em>. Take the key word to connote the <strong>sameness </strong>that characterizes the life in a community of monks. They all have the <strong>same </strong>habits, including the “habit” they wear on their backs. Here we see the monk’s <em>cowl</em>, drawn down over the eyes so that all you can see when you look at him is a <em>mouth</em>. But since monks also speak their prayers in common, it is but a&nbsp;short step to think of <em>one mouth</em> under a <em>hood </em>as the kanji for the <strong>sameness </strong>of monastic life. [6]</div><div><br></div><div>*&nbsp;As a primitive, this kanji will mean <em>monks </em>dressed in a common habit.</div></div>
洞|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Den</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The key word <strong>den </strong>refers to an animal lair hollowed out in the side of a mountain. Now if we keep to the image of the monastic life as an image for <em>same</em>, we can picture a <strong>den </strong>of wild beasts dressed up in habits and living the common life in a mountain cavern. To bring in the element of <em>water </em>we need only give them a sacred “puddle” in the center of their <strong>den</strong>, the focus of all their pious attentions. [9]</div></div>
胴|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Trunk</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The word <strong>trunk </strong>refers to the <em>part of the body</em> that is left when you have “<strong>truncated</strong>” all the limbs. I can hardly think of any reason for doing so, unless one were lumberjacking corpses and needed to have them all properly pruned and made the <em>same </em>so they could be floated downstream without causing a <em>body</em>-jam. [10]</div></div>
向|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Yonder</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Something referred to as “over <strong>yonder</strong>” is usually far off in the distance and barely within sight—like a wee <em>drop </em>in the distance—and is usually an expression used in giving directions or pointing something out.&nbsp;Hence this kanji begins with a <em>drop</em>. Then we find a sort of transparent <em>helmet </em>with no eyes or nose, but only a prominent <em>mouth </em>under it, obviously an extraterrestrial. And what is it jabbering on about with its <em>mouth </em>open like that? Why, about his spaceship way over <strong>yonder </strong>with its fuel tank on empty. [6]</div></div>
尚|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Esteem (think highly of)</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Above we see the primitive for <em>little </em>attached to one of those <em>glass canopies</em> you might use to display a family heirloom. The <em>littleness </em>is important, because what is in fact on display is the shrunken, stuffed, and mounted <em>mouth </em>of an <strong>esteemed </strong>ancestor. We may be used to <strong>esteeming </strong>the words our forebears leave behind, but here we also <strong>esteem</strong> the very <em>mouth</em> that spoke them. I leave it to you to imagine a suitable place in your room for displaying such an unusual conversation piece. [8]</div></div>
字|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Character</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Here is the character for <strong>character </strong>itself. Not just&nbsp;kanji, but any written <strong>character </strong>from hieroglyphs to Sanskrit to our own Roman alphabet. It shows us simply a <em>child </em>in a <em>house</em>. But let us take advantage of the double meaning of the key word to note that just as a <em>child </em>born to a Japanese <em>house </em>is given <strong>characters </strong>for its name, so it is also stamped with the <strong>character </strong>of those who raise it from infancy on. [6]</div></div>
守|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Guard</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The notion of <strong>guarding </strong>something easily brings to mind the image of someone standing <strong>guard</strong>, like the royal soldiers in front of Buckingham Palace or the Pope’s Swiss <strong>Guard</strong>. The whole idea of hiring <strong>guards </strong>is that they should stick like <em>glue </em>to your <em>house </em>to protect it from unwanted prowlers. So go ahead and <em>glue </em>a <strong>guard </strong>to your <em>house </em>in imagination. [6]</div></div>
完|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Perfect</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>In order not to confuse the key word <strong>perfect </strong>with others nearly synonymous in meaning, pull it apart to have a look at its native Latin roots. <em>Per-factum</em> suggests something so “thoroughly made or done” that nothing more needs to be added to it. Now look at the kanji, which does something similar. We see a <em>house </em>that has been made <strong>perfectly </strong>from its <em>beginnings </em>in the foundation to the roof on the top. Now return to FRAME 101 and make sure not to confuse this key word with the kanji for <em>complete</em>. [7]</div></div>
宣|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Proclaim</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Under the primitive for <em>house </em>we meet the kanji for <em>span</em>. Think of the key word in its religious sense of missionary preaching: “<strong>proclaiming </strong>the good news to all nations” and “shouting it from the <em>housetops</em>.” That should be enough to help you remember this simple kanji, used in fact both for traditional missionary work as well as for one of its contemporary replacements: advertising. [9]</div></div>
宵|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Wee hours (overtime?)</strong></div><div><br></div><div>As the key word hints, the kanji in this frame refers to the late evening or early morning hours, well after one should be in bed asleep. It does this by picturing a <em>house </em>with a <em>candle </em>in it. The reason is obvious: whoever is living there is “burning the <em>candle </em>at both ends,” and working night after night into the <strong>wee hours</strong>. [10]</div></div>
安|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Relax</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>To be told that the place of the <em>woman </em>is in the <em>house </em>may not sit well with modern thought, but like all cultural habits the Chinese characters bear the birthmarks of their age. So indulge yourself in a Norman Rockwell image of <strong>relaxing </strong>after a hard day’s work: the scruffy and weary <em>woman </em>of the <em>house </em>slouched asleep in the living room chair, her hair in curlers and a duster lying in her lap. [6]</div></div>
宴|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Banquet (celebratory meal)</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>To carry on from the last frame, we note the entire <em>day </em>of work that comes between a <em>woman </em>and her <em>house </em>in preparing for a dinner <strong>banquet</strong>, pictorially “interrupting” her <em>relaxation</em>. [10]</div></div>
寄|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Draw near</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Let the idea of <strong>drawing near</strong> suggest something dangerous or eerie that one approaches with fear and trembling. Here we see a <em>strange house</em>—perhaps the haunted <em>House </em>of Usher that Edgar Allen Poe immortalized, or the enchanted Gingerbread <em>House </em>that lured Hansel and Gretel to <strong>draw near</strong>. [11]</div></div>
富|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Wealth</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Here we have the original character on which the primitive element for <strong>wealth </strong>is based. In keeping with the story introduced back then, note how all the <strong>wealth </strong>is kept under the roof of the same <em>house</em>. [12]</div></div>
貯|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Savings</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>To avoid confusing this frame with the last one, try to think of <strong>savings </strong>as actual money. The only difference is that our currency is not paper bills but <em>shells</em>, a not uncommon unit of exchange in older civilizations. The <em>nail </em>under the roof of the <em>house </em>points to a hiding place in the rafters on which one strings up one’s <em>shells</em> for safekeeping. [12]</div></div>
木|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Tree</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Here we see a pictograph of a <strong>tree</strong>, showing the main trunk in the long vertical stroke and the boughs in the long horizontal stroke. The final two strokes sweep down in both directions to indicate the roots. Although it may look similar at first sight to the kanji for water (FRAME 137), the order in which it is written is completely different and this affects its final appearance. [4]</div><div><br></div><div>*&nbsp;As a primitive, this kanji can mean <em>tree </em>or <em>wood</em>. When the last two strokes are detached from the trunk (), we shall change its meaning to <em>pole</em>, or <em>wooden pole</em>.</div></div>
林|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Grove</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Learn this frame in connection with the next one. A <strong>grove </strong>is a small cluster of <em>trees</em>. Hence the simple reduplication of the kanji for <em>tree </em>gives us the <strong>grove</strong>. [8]</div></div>
森|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Forest</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>A <strong>forest </strong>is a large expanse of <em>trees</em>, or “t<em>rees, trees everywhere</em>,” to adopt the expression we used back in FRAMES 22 and 23. [12]</div></div>
桂|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Japanese Judas-tree</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Unless you are a botanist, you are not likely to know what a <strong>Japanese Judas-tree</strong> looks like, and probably never even heard of it before, but the name is sufficiently odd to make remembering it easy. Using the primitives as our guide, we define it as a <em>tree </em>with <em>ivy </em>growing down its branches in the shape of a hangman’s rope. [10]</div></div>
柏|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Oak</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>This kanji calls to mind the famous myth of the “golden bough.” As you may recall, what made the sacred <strong>oak </strong>in the forest of Diana the Huntress outside of Rome “golden” were the <em>white </em>berries of the mistletoe that grew in the branches of the tree. When the light of the sun shone through them, they turned yellow and the branch to which they clung appeared to be made of gold. (If you don’t know the story, take a break today and hunt it down in a dictionary of myth and fable. Even if you forget the kanji—which, of course, you won’t—the story of the mistletoe and the fate it brought to Balder the Beautiful is one you are sure to remember.) [9]</div></div>
枠|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Frame</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>You might think of the <strong>frame </strong>this character refers to as the sort of <strong>frame </strong>we have created by drawing a dark line around this kanji and its explanation. Then think of that line as made of very thin <em>wood</em>; and finally note how each time the line bends it forms a 90° angle, thus giving us the <em>nine</em> and the <em>ten</em>. [8]</div></div>
梢|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Treetops</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>As the days grow shorter and shorter, or so the northern European myth goes, the fear grows that the sun will take its leave of us altogether, abandoning the world to total darkness. Fixing <em>candles </em>to the branches of evergreen <em>trees</em>, it was believed, would lure the sun back (like things attracting like things), whence the custom of the lighted tree that eventually found its way into our Christmas customs. The story is a lot longer and more complex than that, but it should help to fix the image of climbing high up into the <strong>treetops </strong>to fix <em>candles </em>on the <em>tree</em>. [11]</div></div>
棚|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Shelf</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>One often thinks of books as “good <em>companions</em>,” but here it is the <strong>shelf </strong>we store them on that is the <em>companion</em>. The reasons should be obvious: it is made of the same stuff, <em>wood</em>, and spends a lot more time with them than we do! Here again, be careful not to let the rationality of the explanation get in the way before you turn it into a proper story. [12]</div></div>
杏|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Apricot</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Since <strong>apricots </strong>can be eaten just as they fall from the <em>trees</em>, picture this <em>mouth </em>agape at the bottom of a <em>tree</em> (just as the elements have it), waiting for <strong>apricots </strong>to fall into it. [7]</div></div>
桐|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Paulownia</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Since you probably don’t know what a <strong>paulownia </strong><em>tree </em>is, we shall let the key word suggest the phrase “the Little Brothers of St. <strong>Paulownia</strong>.” It is a short step to associate the <em>tree </em>with the <em>monks</em> to its right. (For the curious, the name of this oriental <em>tree </em>really comes from a Russian princess, Anna Pavlovna.) [10]</div></div>
植|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Plant</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>You have no doubt seen how people practicing the Japanese art of bonsai take those helpless little saplings and twist them into crippled dwarves before they have a chance to grow up as they should. The more proper way to <strong>plant </strong>a young <em>tree </em>and give it a fair shake in life is to set it into the earth in such a way that it can grow up straight—and <em>straightaway</em>. [12]</div></div>
椅|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Chair</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Instead of making a <strong>chair </strong>out of wood from a <em>tree</em>, this kanji has us making the whole <em>tree</em> into a <strong>chair</strong>, which looks most <em>strange </em>sitting in your living room where the sofa used to be. [12]</div></div>
枯|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Wither</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>What makes a <em>tree </em>begin to <strong>wither </strong>up, and perhaps even die, is a kind of arteriosclerosis that keeps its sap from flowing freely. Usually this is due to simple <em>old </em>age, as this character shows us. Be sure to picture a wrinkled <em>old tree</em>, <strong>withering </strong>away in a retirement center so that the commonsense explanation does not take over. [9]</div></div>
朴|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Crude</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>As all magicians who have passed their apprenticeship know, one makes one’s <em>wand </em>out of a hazel branch and is careful not to alter the natural form of the <em>wood</em>. For the magic of the <em>wand</em> derives its power from its association with the hidden laws of nature, and needs therefore to be kept in its <strong>crude</strong>, natural state. [6]</div></div>
村|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Village</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The character for <em>town </em>was associated with <em>rice fields</em> (FRAME 96) That for a <strong>village</strong>, a step lower on the evolutionary path to cities, shows a circle of <em>trees glued together</em> to measure off the confines of the <strong>village</strong>. [7]</div></div>
相|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Inter-</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>The prefix <strong>inter-</strong> stirs up associations of cooperation&nbsp;among people. From there we read off the elements: <em>tree </em>. . . <em>eye</em>. With only a slight leap of the imagination, those two words call to mind the scriptural proverb about first taking the block of timber out of one’s own <em>eye </em>before helping your neighbors remove the splinters in their eyes. What more useful rule for <strong>inter-</strong>human relationships, and what more useful tool for remembering this kanji! [9]</div></div>
机|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>Desk</b>.</div><div><br></div><div>We need to fix imagination here on two things to learn the kanji for <strong>desk</strong>: the wonderful rough <em>wood </em>of which it has been hewn and the <em>wind </em>that blows across it, sending your papers flying all over the room. These two elements, written in that order, dictate how to write the character. [6]</div></div>
本|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>Book</b>.</div><div><br></div><div>Recalling that <strong>books </strong>are made of paper, and paper made of <em>trees</em>, one might think of a <strong>book</strong> as a slice of a <em>tree</em>. Can you see the “cross-cut” in the trunk of the <em>tree</em>? Picture it as a chain-saw cutting you out a few <strong>books </strong>with which to start your own private library. [5]</div></div>
札|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>Tag</b>.</div><div><br></div><div>The <strong>tags </strong>you see hanging on <em>trees </em>in public places in Japan are helpful to identify what sort of <em>trees </em>they are. Next time you see one, imagine the bit of wire that fixes the <strong>tag </strong>to the branch as a large <em>fishhook</em>.&nbsp;REALLY imagine it, illogical as it is, and you will never have trouble with this kanji again. [5]</div></div>
暦|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>Calendar</b>.</div><div><br></div><div>Look at this character in reverse order, from bottom up. First we see the primitive for <em>days</em>, an appropriate enough way to begin a <strong>calendar</strong>. Next we see a <em>grove of trees</em> growing under a <em>cliff</em>. The laws of nature being what they are, the trees would be stunted under such conditions, unless they were strong enough to keep growing upwards until they passed through the layers of rock and soil, right up to the surface. Now imagine that in those little boxes marking off the <em>days </em>on your wall <strong>calendar</strong>, you see that very process taking place step by step: 365 or so time-lapse pictures of that <em>grove of trees</em> each month, from January under the <em>cliff </em>to December on top of the <em>cliff</em>. The story is not as complex as it sounds, particularly if you happen to have a <strong>calendar </strong>nearby and can flip through it with this image in mind. [14]</div></div>
案|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>Plan</b>.</div><div><br></div><div>Without much effort, the elements <em>relax</em> . . . <em>tree </em>suggest a hammock strung between two <em>trees </em>in your backyard, and you stretched out in it, hands folded behind your head, <strong>planning </strong>something or other. After all, it’s something we all do from time to time: kick up our legs on the nearest piece of furniture and daydream about the best <strong>plan </strong>of action to take. Be sure to relate the <em>relaxation </em>to the <em>tree</em>, so that you&nbsp;don’t end up with something else in its place (like “legs” or “desk” or “table”). [10]</div></div>
燥|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>Parch</b>. -&nbsp;make or become dry through intense heat. "a piece of grassland parched by the sun"</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Parch</strong>ment, made from animal skins, was the most common form of writing material used until the beginning of the nineteenth century. When paper took over, a method was devised to make artificial <strong>parch</strong>ment from <em>wood </em>pulp. The <em>fire </em>at the left and in the “strong” position reminds us of the root word, “<strong>parch</strong>,” since nothing dries, puckers, wrinkles, and scorches quite like <em>fire</em>. And here is how we put it all together. Take a sheet of paper (a “<em>wood-good</em>,”), wet it, and hold it over a <em>hearth </em>in your mind’s eye. Now watch as it <strong>parches </strong>the paper, leaving it with a strange and bumpy surface resembling <strong>parch</strong>ment. [17]</div></div>
未|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Not yet</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><strong></strong>As the key word suggests, this kanji has to do with something not quite over and done with. More concretely, it shows us a <em>tree </em>that is <strong>not yet</strong> fully grown. The extra short stroke in the upper branches shows new branches spreading out, leaving one with the feeling that the <em>tree </em>has a ways to go yet before it reaches maturity. In other words, the kanji conveys its meaning pictographically, playing on the earlier pictograph of the <em>tree</em>. [5]</div></div>
末|<h1>My own mnemonic</h1><div><div>Meaning:&nbsp;<strong>Obscure (unclear / uncertain)</strong><br></div><div>Primary: End</div><div><br></div><div>You see an <b>obscure&nbsp;</b><span class="radical-highlight" rel="tooltip" title="Radical" style="background-color: rgb(0, 170, 255); color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">jet</span>&nbsp;at the distance.

Be sure to give the <em>sun </em>a professorial demeanor, complete with spectacles and a pipe. [5]</div></div>
昧|<h1>My own mnemonic</h1><div>The sun is blazing hot and radiates heat onto the modified jet. The jet has reached the <b>extremity </b>of it's heat-tolerance. How will this end for our beloved kanji?!</div><h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Extremity</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><strong></strong>This character is best learned in connection with FRAME 229. The first stroke shows a branch that is longer than the main branch, indicating that the tree has reached the <strong>extremity </strong>of its growth, so that its branches stop spreading and start drooping downwards. Be sure to keep this imagery in mind, to avoid confusing this key word with synonyms that will appear later. [5]</div></div>
沫|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Splash</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><strong></strong>The <strong>splash </strong>this kanji refers to is the dash of <em>water </em>against the rocks, with all the foam and spray that this creates. If you think of a <strong>splash </strong>in this sense as a wave that has run its full course and reached its <em>extremity</em>, namely the seashore, and if you think of it pictorially in your mind’s eye, this somewhat rare (but oh-so-easy-to-learn) kanji is yours for good. [8]</div></div>
味|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Flavor</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><strong></strong>When a tree has <em>not yet</em> finished growing, it produces fruit with a full <strong>flavor</strong>. When the official taster (the professional <em>mouth </em>to the left) determines that full <strong>flavor </strong>has been reached, the tree is pruned back so that it remains permanently <em>not yet</em> grown. A neat&nbsp;little agricultural trick and an easy way to see the sense of <strong>flavor </strong>hidden in this character. [8]</div></div>
妹|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Younger sister</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><strong></strong>The <strong>younger sister</strong> in the family is the <em>woman </em>in the family who, like the newest branch in a tree, is <em>not yet</em> old enough or mature enough to do everything the elder sister can do (see FRAME 442). [8]</div></div>
朱|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Vermilion</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><strong></strong>That red-orange color we call <strong>vermilion </strong>is found in nature during the fall when the leaves lose their sugar and begin to change color. This kanji depicts the very last leaf on a tree in the fall (the <em>drop </em>hung in the first stroke), the leaf that has <em>not yet</em> fallen as it one day must. Look at its color—<strong>vermilion</strong>. (Well, not really. The truth is, <strong>vermilion </strong>is made from a mercuric sulfide, but I’m sure you will agree that autumn leaves are a lot easier to work with.) [6]</div></div>
株|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Stocks</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><strong></strong>The <strong>stocks </strong>bought and sold on the market by the tens of millions each day get their name from a comparison to a healthy <em>tree</em>, in which one takes “<strong>stock</strong>” in the hopes that it will grow and produce more and more <em>trees </em>like itself. Usually good <strong>stocks </strong>are referred to as “blue chip,” but here we are asked to associate the key word with the color <em>vermilion</em>, perhaps because one can assess the value of a tree from the color of its autumn leaves. [10]</div></div>
若|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Young</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><strong></strong>Here we see a <em>flower </em>held in the <em>right </em>hand. You can imagine yourself in a magic garden where <em>flowers </em>picked with the <em>right </em>hand grant eternal <strong>youth</strong>; and those picked with the left, premature senility. Go ahead, pick one with each hand and watch what happens. [8]</div></div>
草|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Grass</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><strong></strong>Perhaps you know the custom of seeding <strong>grass </strong>randomly or in some particular pattern with the <em>flower </em>called the crocus, which blooms for a few days each year in <em>early </em>spring. As the <strong>grass </strong>begins to turn green again after winter has passed, these tiny <em>flowers </em>dot up here and there. Now just look out your window at a patch of <strong>grass </strong>somewhere and think what a nice idea it would be to have your name&nbsp;spelled out in <em>flowers </em>once as a sort of <em>early </em>harbinger of spring. [9]</div></div>
苦|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Suffering</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><strong></strong>The picture of <strong>suffering </strong>we are given here is that of a <em>flower </em>that has grown <em>old</em>. When a flower ages, it pales and dries up, and probably even <strong>suffers</strong>. If you think that plants are incapable of such feelings, then ask yourself why so many people believe that talking to their flowers helps them bloom better. [8]</div></div>
苛|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Bullying</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><strong></strong>A nosegay of <em>flowers </em>make a nice gift, but if those flowers are poison oak, they can amount to <strong>bullying</strong>. Be sure to emphasize the word <em>can </em>when you repeat this little phrase to yourself. [8]</div></div>
寛|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Tolerant</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><strong></strong>The <em>house of flowers</em> or “hothouse” has become a metaphor for a narrow-minded, biased, and intolerant attitude distrustful of change. <strong>Tolerance</strong>, in contrast, is open-minded and welcomes novelty. The way to encourage <strong>tolerance</strong> in those who lack it is first to have them <em>see </em>through their own hothouse attitudes, which is the very counsel we are given in this kanji. [13]</div></div>
薄|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Dilute</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><strong></strong>Take a good look at this kanji: the “strong” element here is really the <em>flower</em>, not the <em>water</em> as you might have thought on first glance. To the right is the <em>acupuncturist </em>from FRAME 48. Taking the key word to connote <strong>diluting </strong>the vital humors of the body, we can imagine our <em>acupuncturist </em>performing his task with <em>flowers</em> in place of needles, and using their hollow stems to pipe <em>water </em>into the body of the patient. [16]</div></div>
葉|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Leaf</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><strong></strong>Three elements are given here: <em>flower </em>. . . <em>generation </em>. . . <em>tree</em>. The first and last seem logical enough, since it is the <strong>leaf</strong> that feeds the <em>flowers </em>on a <em>tree</em>. The element for <em>generation </em>interposed between the two suggests that the movement of a <em>tree </em>from one <em>generation </em>to the next is like its “turning over a new <strong>leaf</strong>.” [12]</div></div>
模|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Imitation</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><strong></strong>Ah, but haven’t modern <em>graveyards </em>become a parody of their ancestors! The flowers are plastic, the writing on the stones is unimaginative and cold, and the whole thing looks more like a marble orchard than a right and proper graveyard. This kanji continues with the modernization trend by picturing <strong>imitation </strong><em>trees</em> in the <em>graveyard</em>. But of course, how convenient! They don’t need pruning or fertilizing, their leaves don’t fall, and they remain the same color all year long. [14]</div></div>
漠|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Vague</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><strong></strong>Think of the key word as having to do with something viewed through a haze, or in the twilight and from a distance, so that only its outlines are <strong>vaguely </strong>discernible. Now we are back again to the essence of the true <em>graveyard</em>. The <em>water </em>may be taken as the sound of waves dashing up against the rocks or the dripping of moisture on cold rock—anything that helps you associate <strong>vagueness </strong>with the <em>graveyard </em>and keep it distinct from the imitation we met in the last frame. [13]</div></div>
墓|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Grave</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><strong></strong>The mounds of <em>soil</em> with crude wooden crosses set at their head suggests those boot-hill <strong>graves </strong>we all know from cowboy lore. The only odd thing about this kanji is that the <em>soil </em>comes UNDER the <em>graveyard</em>, rather than to its left, where we might expect. Just think of the bodies as “lying under boot-hill” if you have any trouble.</div><div><br></div><div>By the way, this is not the first time, nor will it be the last, that we learn a kanji whose key word is the same, or almost the same, as a primitive element based on it, but whose shape differs somewhat. There is no cause to worry. By using the primitive in a variety of other characters, as we have done here, the confusion will be averted as a matter of course. In most cases, as here, the primitive element is taken from a part of the fuller kanji. [13]</div></div>
暮|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Livelihood</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><strong></strong>Imagine that you have chosen the occupation of the keeper of a <em>graveyard</em> and spend your <em>days </em>tending to other’s deadhood in order to make your means of <strong>livelihood</strong>. [14]</div></div>
膜|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Membrane</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><strong></strong>The <em>part of the body</em> first affected by a stroll through a haunted <em>graveyard </em>is the skin, which gets goose bumps. But we save the word “skin” for another kanji, and use the odd word “<strong>membrane</strong>” here. Think of being so scared through and through that the goose flesh moves from the outside in, giving you goose <strong>membranes</strong>. [14]</div></div>
苗|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Seedling</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><strong></strong>To avoid confusion with the image of rice <em><strong>seedlings </strong></em>to appear later, we shall take these <strong>seedlings </strong>out of their agricultural setting in the <em>rice fields</em> and into the frame of Brave New World surgery, where “ideas” or&nbsp;“values” are being implanted into <em>brains </em>like <strong>seedlings</strong> to insure a harmonious society. Then you need only imagine them taking root and breaking out into <em>flower </em>right through the tops of the skulls of people walking around on the streets. [8]</div></div>
兆|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>Portent (omen / sign / indication / warning / forewarning)</b>.<b>&nbsp;</b></div><div><br></div><div>Here we have a pictograph of the back of a turtle, the two sloping vertical strokes representing the central ridge and the four short strokes the pattern. Think of reading turtle shells as a way to foretell the future, and in particular things that <strong>portend </strong>coming evils. [6]</div><div><br></div><div>*&nbsp;When this character is used as a primitive in its full form, we keep the key-word sense of a <em>portent</em>. When it appears to the left in its abbreviated form (namely, the left half only, ⺦), we shall give it the pictographic sense of a <em>turtle</em>.</div></div>
桃|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Peach tree</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>To associate the <strong>peach tree</strong> with the primitive for a <em>portent</em>, recall the famous Japanese legend of Momotarō, the <strong>Peach </strong>Boy. It begins once upon a time with a fisherman and his wife who wanted badly to have a child, but none was born to them. Then one day the old man caught a giant <strong>peach</strong>, out of which jumped a healthy young lad whom they named <strong>Peach</strong> Boy. Though the boy was destined to perform heroic deeds, his birth also <em>portended </em>great misfortune (how else could he become a hero?). Thus the <em>tree </em>that is associated with a <em>portent </em>of coming evil comes to be the <strong>peach tree</strong>. [10]</div></div>
眺|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Stare</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>To give someone the “evil <em>eye</em>” is to <strong>stare </strong>at them, wishing them evil. The roots of the superstition are old and almost universal throughout the cultures of the world. In this kanji, too, being stared at is depicted as an <em>eye </em>that <em>portends </em>evil. [11]</div></div>
犬|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Stare</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>We know that the kanji for <em>large </em>takes on the meaning of the <em>St. Bernard</em> <strong>dog </strong>when used as a primitive. In this frame we finally see why. The <em>drop </em>added as a fourth and final stroke means that we have to do with a normal-sized <strong>dog</strong>, which, compared to the <em>St. Bernard</em>, is no more than a <em>drop </em>in the kennel. [4]</div><div><br></div><div>*&nbsp;As a primitive this character can take two meanings. In the form given here it will mean a&nbsp;very small dog (which we shall refer to as a <em>chihuahua </em>for convenience sake). When it takes the form ⺨ to the left of a character, we shall give it the meaning of a p<em>ack of wild dogs</em>.</div></div>
状|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Status quo</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Did you ever hear the legend of the <em>turtle </em>who fell madly in love with a <em>chihuahua</em> but could not have her because their two families did not like the idea of their children intermarrying? Like all classic stories of ill-fated love, this one shows how the young upset the <strong>status quo</strong> with an emotion older and more powerful than anything their elders have devised to counter it: blind love. [7]</div></div>
黙|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Silence</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Oddly enough, the character for <strong>silence </strong>shows us a <em>black chihuahua</em>. Actually, the cute little critter’s name is Darkness, as I am sure you remember from the famous song about <strong>silence </strong>that begins, “Hello, Darkness, my old friend.…” Note how the four dots reach all the way across the bottom of the character. [15]</div></div>
然|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Sort of thing</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><em></em>The key word in this frame refers to a suffix that gives the word before it an adjectival quality; hence we refer to it as “<strong>sort of thing</strong>.” Reverting to the time when dog was more widely eaten than it is today (see FRAME 127), we see here a large cauldron boiling over an <em>oven flame</em> with the <em>flesh</em> of a <em>chihuahua</em> being thrown into the whole concoction to&nbsp;make it into a “hot-diggity, dog-diggity” <strong>sort of thing</strong>. [12]</div></div>
荻|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><br></div><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Reed</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>You’ve no doubt seen cattails, those swamp <strong>reeds </strong>with a furry <em>flower </em>to them like the tail of a cat. This might just turn out to be a good way to get rid of a troublesome pack of <em>wild dogs</em>: lure them into a swamp of these <strong>reeds </strong>with the cattail <em>flowers </em>and then set <em>fire </em>to the swamp. Take care to focus on the <em>flower </em>rather than the “cattail” to avoid confusion with FRAME 259 below. [10]</div></div>
狩|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Hunt</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>One of the worst problems you have to face when you go <strong>hunting</strong> is to <em>guard</em> your take from the <em>wild dogs</em>. If you imagine yourself failing at the task, you will probably have a stronger image than if you try to picture yourself succeeding. [9]</div></div>
猫|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>Cat</b>.</div><div><br></div><div><em></em><em></em><em></em><em></em><em></em>Knowing how much dogs love to chase <strong>cats</strong>, picture a <em>pack of wild dogs</em> planting “<strong>cat</strong>-seedlings,” watering them, and fertilizing them until they can be harvested as a crop of <strong>cats </strong>for them to chase and torment. If you begin from the key word and think of a “crop of <strong>cats</strong>,” you will not confuse this story with the apparently similar story of two frames ago. [11]</div></div>
牛|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Cow</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Can you see the “doodle” of a <strong>cow</strong> that has just been run over by a steamroller? The small dot in the first stroke shows its head turned to one side, and the next two strokes, the four legs. [4]</div><div><br></div><div>* As a primitive, the same sense of <em>cow</em> is kept. Note only that when it is placed OVER another element, its tail is cut off, giving us . In this case, and when the element appears on the left, the stroke order is changed.</div></div>
特|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Special</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Despite the strong phonetic similarity, there will be no problem keeping the key word <strong>special</strong> distinct from the character we met earlier for <em>specialty</em> (FRAME 47), since the latter has immediate connotations lacking in this kanji.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Anyway, we shall let the key word of this frame refer to something in a <strong>special</strong> class all its own—like the sacred <em>cows</em> of India that wander freely without fear of being butchered and ground into hamburger. Even though the practice is originally a Hindu one, and in any case no longer followed among the majority of Japanese Buddhist monks, the Buddha’s refusal to take the life of any sentient being makes it only fitting that the <em>cows</em> should be placed on the sacred grounds of a <em>Buddhist temple</em> in this kanji. [10]</div></div>
告|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Revelation</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Folklore throughout the world tells us of talking animals who show a wisdom superior to that of&nbsp;human beings, and that same tradition has found its way into television shows and cartoons right into our own century. This character depicts <strong>revelation</strong> through the <em>mouth</em> of a <em>cow</em>, suggesting oracular utterances about truths hidden to human intelligence. [7]</div></div>
先|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Before</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>Take this key word in its physical, not its temporal, sense (even though it refers to both). If you have a <em>cow</em> with <em>human legs</em>, as the elements show us here, it can only be because you have two people in a <em>cow</em>-suit. I always thought I’d prefer to be the one standing <strong>before</strong>, rather than the one that holds up the rear and becomes the “butt” of everyone’s laughter. [6]</div></div>
洗|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Wash</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>This character is so logical that one is tempted to let the elements speak for themselves: <em>water</em> . . . <em>before</em>. But we have already decided we will not allow such rationalism to creep into our stories. Not even this once.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Instead, let us change the character from the Peanuts comic strip called “Pigpen,” who is always preceded by a little cloud of dust and grime, and rename him “<strong>Wash</strong>-Out.” Everywhere he walks, a spray of <em>water</em> goes <em>before</em> him to sanitize everything he touches. [9]</div></div>
介|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Jammed in (fastklemt).</strong></div><div><br></div><div>The idea of something getting <strong>jammed in</strong>to something else is depicted here by having a <em>walking stick</em> get <strong>jammed in</strong>to an <em>umbrella</em> frame by someone shoving it into an already occupied slot in the <em>umbrella</em> stand at the door. First notice the vertical strokes: on the left is the curved <em>umbrella</em> handle, and on the right the straight <em>walking stick</em>. Now try to imagine the two parties tugging at their respective properties like two kids on a wishbone, creating a scene at the entrance of an elegant restaurant. [4]</div></div>
界|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>World</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div>As the <strong>world</strong> gets <em>jammed</em> with more and more&nbsp;people, there is less and less space. Imagine yourself taking an air flight over a <strong>world</strong> so densely populated that every bit of it is sectioned off like a gigantic checkerboard (the <em>rice fields</em>). If you look closely at the character, you should be able to see a kind of movement taking place as still more is being <strong>jammed in</strong>to that already narrow space. [9]</div></div>
茶|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Tea</strong>.<br></div><div><br></div><div>As everyone knows, <strong>tea</strong> is made from <strong>tea</strong> leaves. But the <strong>tea</strong> plant itself has its own <em>flowers</em>, which can be quite beautiful and add a special flavor to the <strong>tea</strong>, as the Chinese found out already over 4,598 years ago. With the image of a terrace of <em>flowering</em> <strong>tea</strong> bushes in mind, picture a number of brightly painted and very l-o-n-g <em>wooden poles</em> (FRAME 207) placed here and there in their midst, with a tiny <em>umbrella</em> at the top to shade the delicate-tasting <strong>tea</strong> <em>flowers</em>. [9]</div></div>
脊|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Spinal column</strong>.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The <strong>spinal column</strong> has sprouted out of the <em>flesh</em> of your back into an <em>umbrella</em> that you always have with you, rain or shine. The pair of 2s on each side are the “ribs” of the <em>umbrella</em>. Take care to keep your image of the key word distinct from that for spine (FRAME 24). [10]</div></div>
合|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Fit</strong>.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The kanji for <strong>fit</strong> reads literally, top to bottom, as a <em>meeting of mouths</em>—which is a rather descriptive way of speaking of a romantic kiss. We all know what happens when there is no meeting of minds and when people’s ideas don’t <strong>fit</strong> with one another. But this kanji invites us to imagine what happened to the romance of a certain unfortunate couple whose <em>mouths</em> didn’t <strong>fit</strong>. [6]</div></div>
塔|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>Pagoda</strong>.<br></div><div><br></div><div>On the left we see a mound of <em>dirt</em>, and to the right <em>flowers</em> made to <em>fit</em> together. The two sides combine to create a great <strong>pagoda</strong> made of <em>dirt</em>, with <em>flowers</em> by the tens of thousands <em>fitted</em> together for the roofing of each of the layers. Be sure to put yourself in the scene and <em>fit</em> a few of the <em>flowers</em> in place yourself so that the image works its way into memory with full force. [12]</div></div>
王|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>king</b>.<br></div><div><br></div><div>See what you can do to come up with a pictograph of a <strong>king’s</strong> scepter here that suits your own idea of what it should look like. You might even begin with&nbsp;the basic element for <em>I beam</em> and then try to fit the remaining third stroke in. [4]</div><div><br></div><div>*&nbsp;As a primitive, this can mean either <em>king</em> or <em>scepter</em>, but it will usually be taken to mean <em>ball</em>, as an abbreviation of the character in the next frame.</div></div>
玉|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>jewel</b>.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Note the <em>drop</em> here in the king’s <em>scepter</em>, which is exactly what you would expect it to be: a precious <strong>jewel</strong> handed down from of old as a symbol of his wealth and power. [5]</div><div><br></div><div>*&nbsp;As a primitive, we can use this to mean either <em>jewel</em> or <em>ball</em>. When it appears anywhere other than on the left side of a kanji, it generally takes the same shape as here. On the left, it will be lacking the final stroke, making it the same as the character in the previous frame, .</div></div>
宝|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>treasure</b>.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Every <em>house</em> has its <strong>treasure</strong>, as every thief knows only too well. While the things we <strong>treasure</strong> most are usually of sentimental value, we take the original sense of the term <strong>treasure</strong> here and make it refer to <em>jewels</em> kept in one’s <em>house</em>. [8]</div></div>
珠|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>pearl</b>.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Take care to keep the meaning of this kanji distinct from that for <em>jewel</em>. Think of the most enormous&nbsp;<strong>pearl</strong> you have ever seen, a great <em>vermilion</em>-colored <em>ball</em> sitting on your ring—and making it extremely difficult to move without falling over from the weight of the thing. [10]</div></div>
現|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>present</b>.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Do not think of a “gift” here, but of the <strong>present</strong> moment, as distinct from the future and the past. The kanji gives us a <em>ball</em> in which we see the <strong>present</strong>— obviously a crystal <em>ball</em> that enables us to see things going on at the <strong>present</strong> in faraway places. [11]</div></div>
玩|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>toy</b>.<br></div><div><br></div><div>If, at some aboriginal level, <strong>Toys</strong> R Us, then the archetypal <em>ball</em> must have been there at the <em>beginning</em>, before evolving into beach balls, pingpong balls, rugby balls, and marbles. [8]</div></div>
狂|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>lunatic</b>.<br></div><div><br></div><div>A <strong>lunatic </strong>is literally one driven mad by the light of the moon, and the most famous of the “<strong>looneys</strong>” are the legendary lycanthropes or “wolfmen.” Sometimes the transformation is only a temporary phenomenon, sometimes it is permanent. In the latter case, the poor chap takes off on all fours to live with the beasts. To remember this kanji, imagine one of these lycanthropes going <strong>looney </strong>and setting himself up as <em>king </em>of a <em>pack of wild dogs</em> that roams about and terrorizes innocent suburban communities. [7]</div></div>
旺|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <b>effulgent (strålende; overdådig).</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>The radiant, <strong>effulgent</strong> splendor of the <em>sun</em> makes it <em>king</em> of all the planets and other stars. Just to be sure you don’t take this too abstractly, picture the <em>sun</em> seated on a throne, flourishing its <em>scepter</em> this way and that. [8]</div></div>
皇|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>emperor</strong><b>.</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>An <strong>emperor</strong>, as we all know, is a ruler—something like a <em>king</em> but higher in status. The <em>white bird</em> perched above the <em>king</em>, elevating him to <strong>imperial</strong> heights, is the messenger he sends back and forth to the gods to request advice and special favors, something that <em>white birds</em> have long done in folklore throughout the world. [9]</div></div>
呈|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>display</strong><strong>.</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><em></em><em></em><em></em>The trick to remembering this character lies in associating the key word with the line from the nursery rhyme about 4 and 20 blackbirds baked in a pie: “Wasn’t this a dainty dish to set before the <em>king</em>?” If we think of <strong>display</strong> in terms of that famous line, and the <em>king</em> with his head thrown back and his <em>mouth</em> wide open as 4 and 20 blackbirds fly in one after the other, we shall have satisfied both the elements and their position. [7]</div></div>
全|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>whole</strong><strong>.</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><em></em><em></em><em></em><strong>Wholeness</strong> suggests physical and spiritual health, “having your act together.” The kanji-image for <strong>wholeness</strong> depicts being “<em>king</em> under your own <em>umbrella</em>,” that is, giving order to your own life. I know it sounds terribly abstract, but what could be more abstract than the word <strong>whole</strong>? [6]</div></div>
栓|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>plug</strong><strong>.</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><em></em><em></em><em></em><strong></strong><em></em><em></em><em></em><em></em>Here we think of <strong>plug </strong>in the sense of a cork or stopper used to seal the mouth of a bottle, water faucet, or something with liquid running out of it. Forgetting the abstract picture of the former frame, let us work with all the primitive units: <em>tree </em>. . . <em>umbrella </em>. . . <em>ball</em>. Imagine a <em>tree </em>with a faucet in the side out of which tennis <em>balls </em>are flowing, bouncing all over the ground by the hundreds. You fight your way up to it and shove your giant beach <em>umbrella </em>into the <em>tree </em>to <strong>plug </strong>it up. [10]</div></div>
理|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>logic</strong><strong>.</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><em></em><em></em><em></em><strong></strong><em></em><em></em><em></em><em></em>We first referred to this character back in FRAME 185, to which you might want to return to have a peek. The image of <strong>logic </strong>we are given is something like a central <em>jewel </em>in a computer, like the <em>jewels </em>in old clocks that keep them running smoothly. Try to picture yourself making your way through all the RAMS and ROMS and approaching this shining <em>jewel</em>, a chorus of voices and a blast of trumpets in the background heralding the great seat of all-knowing <strong>logic</strong>. [11]</div></div>
主|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>lord</strong><strong>.</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><em></em><em></em><em></em><strong></strong><em></em><em></em><em></em><em></em>“A man’s home is his castle,” goes the proverb from an age where it was the male who was <strong>lord </strong>of the household. Fundamentally, it means only that every one of us is a bit (or <em>drop</em>) of a <em>king </em>in our own environment. As for the positioning of the elements, if you take care to “read off” the primitives in this way, you won’t end up putting the <em>drop </em>down below, where it turns the kanji into a jewel. [5]<br></div><div><br></div><div>*&nbsp;As a primitive element, we set the key word aside entirely and take it as a pictograph of a solid brass <em>candlestick </em>(with the drop representing the flame at the top).</div></div>
注|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>pour.</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><em></em><em></em><em></em><strong></strong><em></em><em></em><em></em><em></em>Picture <strong>pouring</strong> <em>water </em>from a lighted <em>candlestick</em>. What could be more ridiculous, or simpler, as a way to recall this kanji? [8]</div></div>
柱|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>pillar.</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><em></em><em></em><em></em><strong></strong><em></em><em></em><em></em><em></em>The <strong>pillar </strong>referred to here is the <em>wooden </em>beam that stands at the entrance to a traditional Japanese house. Carve it in imagination into the shape of a gigantic <em>candlestick </em>and your work is done. [9]</div></div>
金|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>gold.</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><em></em><em></em><em></em><strong></strong><em></em><em></em><em></em><em></em>If this were not one of the most common characters you will ever have to write, I would apologize for&nbsp;having to give the explanation that follows. Anyway, we want to depict bars of <strong>gold </strong>bullion with an <em>umbrella </em>overhead to shade them from the heat (and perhaps to hide them as well). The bullion is made by melting down all the <em>scepters </em>of the kingdom, <em>drop</em> by <em>drop</em>, and shaping them into bars. [8]</div><div><br></div><div>* As a primitive, it means not only <em>gold </em>but any <em>metal </em>at all.</div></div>
銑|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>pig iron (råjern).</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><em></em><em></em><em></em><strong></strong><em></em><em></em><em></em><em></em><strong>Pig iron</strong> refers to iron in the crude form in which it emerges from the smelting furnaces. Of all the various forms <em>metal </em>can take, this one shows us metal <em>before </em>it has been refined. Imagine two photographs labeled “before” and “after” to show the process. [14]</div></div>
鉢|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>bowl.</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><em></em><em></em><em></em><strong></strong><em></em><em></em><em></em><em></em><strong></strong>Let <strong>bowl </strong>suggest a large and heavy <em>golden </em><strong>bowl </strong>into which you are throwing all the <em>books </em>you own to mash them into pulp, for some outrageous reason you will have to think up yourself. [13]</div></div>
銅|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>chopper.</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>Picture an order of <em>monks </em>serving as chaplains for the police force. Their special habit, made of protective <em>metal</em>, is distinguished by a row of copper buttons just like the “<strong>cops</strong>” they serve. [14]</div></div>
釣|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>angling (fiske / sportsfiske).</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>The character we learned for <em>fishing </em>(FRAME 184) refers to the professional, net-casting industry, while the <strong>angling </strong>of this character refers to the sport. The odd thing is that your <strong>angling </strong>rod is a <em>golden ladle</em> which you are using to scoop <em>gold</em>fish out of a river. [11]</div></div>
針|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>needle.</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>In FRAME 10 we referred ahead to this full character from which the primitive for <em>needle </em>(on the right) derives. Since we already expect that <strong>needles </strong>are made of <em>metal</em>, let us picture a set of solid <em>gold </em>darning <em>needles </em>to complete the kanji. [10]</div></div>
銘|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>inscription.</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>Take <strong>inscription </strong>in the sense of the <em>name </em>you ask the jeweler to carve on a <em>gold </em>bracelet or inside a <em>gold </em>ring to identify its owner or communicate some sentimental message. It will help if you can recall the first time you had this done and the feelings you had at the time. [14]</div></div>
鎮|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>tranquilize (beroligende; lindrende).</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><em></em><em></em><em></em><strong></strong><em></em><em></em><em></em><em></em><strong></strong>The first lie-detector machines of the twentieth century worked by wiring pieces of <em>metal </em>to the body to measure the amount of sweat produced when questions were asked. It was discovered that nervousness produced more sweat, indicating&nbsp;subconscious reactions when the <em>truth </em>was getting too close for comfort. Nowadays, people can take drugs that <strong>tranquilize </strong>them in such a way as to neutralize the effect of the device, which is why other means have had to be developed. [18]</div></div>
道|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>road-way.</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>The key word carries both the sense of a <strong>road </strong>for transit and a <strong>way </strong>or method of doing something, but the former is better for forming an image. The primitives read: the <em>neck </em>of a <em>road</em>. Think of a crowded <strong>road-way</strong> where traffic has come to a standstill—what we commonly refer to as a “bottle<em>neck</em>.” [12]</div></div>
導|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>guidance (veiledning).</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>When we accept someone’s <strong>guidance</strong>, we permit ourselves to be <em>glued </em>to a certain <em>road </em>or <em>way </em>of doing something, and try to “stick” to it. [15]</div></div>
辻|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>crossing (kryssing).</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><em></em><em></em><em></em><strong></strong><em></em><em></em><em></em><em></em><strong></strong>Take the first two strokes in the sense we gave them back in FRAME 10, as the pictograph of a <em>cross</em>, and set it on a <em>road </em>to create a “<strong>crossing</strong>.” [5]</div></div>
迅|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>swift (fort / rask).</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>Here we see a <em>crossing </em>in the form of a barbed <em>hook</em>, suggesting a <strong>swifter </strong>alternate not only to the roundabouts used in Europe but also to the “cloverleaf” design used on superhighways in the United States. [6]</div></div>
造|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>create.</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>Think of <strong>creating </strong>as making something out of nothing. Then recall how the <em>way </em>of <em>revelation </em>laid out in the Bible begins with the story of how God <strong>created </strong>the world out of a dark and chaotic nothingness. [10]</div></div>
迫|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>urge (trang / oppfordrer).</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>To <strong>urge </strong>someone to do something, you make the <em>way </em>as appealing as possible, perhaps even <em>white</em>washing it a bit. [8]</div></div>
逃|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>escape.</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>When <strong>escaping </strong>from something or someone, one always feels as if one is not going fast enough, like a <em>turtle </em>on an expressway. (Since the <em>turtle </em>is on the <em>road </em>and not on the left, it can keep its full kanji shape as given in FRAME 250.) [9]</div></div>
辺|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>environs (omgivelsene / omegn).</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>To keep the <strong>environs </strong>clean and safe, you could cement <em>daggers </em>in the <em>road</em>, blades pointed upwards, so that no polluting traffic could pass by. You could, if you were an ecologically minded terrorist. [5]</div></div>
巡|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>patrol (patrulje).</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>A virtual <em>flood </em>of motorcycle police washing down a <em>road </em>is this kanji’s image for a <strong>patrol</strong>. [6]</div></div>
車|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>car.</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>You may keep the whole range of connotations for this key word, <strong>car</strong>, provided it does not interfere with the pictograph. Look for the front and back wheels (the first and last horizontal strokes) and the seat in the carriage in the middle. As an exercise, try to isolate the primitives on your own and make a story out of them. [7]</div><div><br></div><div>*&nbsp;<em>Car</em>, <em>cart</em>, <em>wagon</em>, and <em>vehicle </em>may all be used as primitive meanings.</div></div>
連|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>take along.</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>What you are meant to <strong>take along</strong> in this kanji are not things but people. The image of the <em>car </em>on the <em>road </em>should ground your image for picking up your friends to <em>take </em>them <em>along </em>to wherever you are going. [10]</div></div>
軌|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>rut (hjulspor).</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>Combine the primary and secondary meanings of this key word to form your story. Begin with the <em>car </em>whose tires get caught in a <strong>rut </strong>and spin without going anywhere. Then go on to the <em>baseball team</em> who can’t win a game because it has fallen into a <strong>rut </strong>of losing. [9]</div></div>
輸|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>transport.</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>On the left we see a <em>vehicle </em>used for <strong>transport</strong>. On the right, we see a new tangle of elements that need sorting out. The first three strokes, you will remember, are the primitive for <em>meeting</em>. Below it we see the elements for <em>flesh </em>and <em>saber</em>, which combine to create a compound element for a <em>butcher </em>and his trade. Together they give us the image of a “truckers’ convoy.” [16]</div></div>
喩|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>metaphor.</strong></div><div>People who try to sound literary often end up butchering the language. Here we see a <em>meeting </em>of <em>butchers </em>whose <em>mouths </em>are producing the <strong>metaphors</strong>. [12]</div></div>
前|<h1>Remembering the kanji 1</h1><div><div>Meaning: <strong>In front</strong>.</div><div><br></div><div><em></em><em></em><em></em>We waited to introduce this character until now, even though we had all the elements, because it helps to reinforce the odd kanji of the last frame. Picture the <em>butcher</em> hacking away with his knife at a slab of meat on his table with a pair of ram’s <em>horns </em>placed <strong>in front</strong> of him (or on his head, if you prefer).<br></div><div>There is no need to worry about confusing this kanji with that for <em>before </em>(FRAME 263), since it will not appear as a primitive in any other character used in this book.

Use the <em>genie </em>out in the open when the primitive appears to the right of or below its relative primitive; in that case it also keeps its same form. At the left, the form is altered to , and the meaning becomes a <em>genie in the bottle</em>.</div></div>

If you need any help at all with this character, you may picture it as two hands of a clock pointing to what time it is <strong>now</strong>. The element above it, <em>meeting</em>, should easily relate to that image.
